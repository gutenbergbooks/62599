<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> Had you tiptoed to the very edge of a

certain spot in its canvas wall kept bulging in

into place, only to start jiggling a moment
later, just as though there were some one
inside the tent, clutching at its wall and shaking
it, much as a monkey rattles the bars to
its cage.</p>

<p class='c012'>As for the open space between the little
white tent and all the bigger circus tents—for
the tents were all a part of Spangleland—there
was no sign of life. True, there were
gayly dressed men scattered about here and
there—and women, too. But all were fast
asleep. Some lay back in low, canvas chairs
strung in a row in the shadow of the tents.
Some, with their chins propped in their hands,
were perched like pigeons on the tongues of
wonderful red and golden wagons; while still
others lay at full length on the cool, green
grass. The lap of one was covered by a
newspaper and that of another held an open
book, just as if their owners had grown weary
of reading and dozed off to sleep, square in the
middle of a sentence.</p>

<p class='c012'>So there was no sign of life, except the
jiggling of the wall of the round, white tent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>that stood in the center of all the bigger
tents.</p>

<p class='c012'>Meantime the day was fast making ready
for bed. Indeed, the sun was just on the point
of slipping out of sight behind the very largest
of all the bigger tents when, far off in the sky
to the west, there appeared—a tiny black
speck. And at this the wall of the round white
tent began to jiggle more violently than before,
while a wee little eye appeared, peeking
through a wee little hole in its wall. And, as
the wee eye watched, the speck grew in size
and then began to describe little curves, as if
it were bounding up and down as it came.
And, for that matter, so it was. For the speck
was a bird on the wing, and it was headed
straight for the tents of Spangleland. On it
came, until it had reached the very edge of the
circus town. And then it began to bound up
and down even more than before, and to circle
this way and that, as if to make sure of some
certain thing of which it alone knew the secret.
But it flew more slowly now, so that one
might have seen—had any been there to see—that
its color was a wondrous blue and of so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>gorgeous a hue that the red and golden
wagons—which were just at that moment
struck by the sun’s parting rays—must have
felt very much ashamed of themselves.</p>

<p class='c012'>Finally, as if no longer in doubt, the bird
fixed its eyes on the little white tent, and flew
straight to the wee hole in its wall. And, as it
reached the tent, it began to call, in the softest
voice imaginable:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O, Dan, Dan, Diggeldy Dan!</div>
      <div class='line'>O, Dan, Dan, Diggeldy Dan!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>While from behind the wall of the round
white tent came the merriest of voices in reply,
singing, almost as softly:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Here’s Dan, Dan, Diggeldy Dan;</div>
      <div class='line'>Here’s Dan, Dan, Diggeldy Dan!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Then,” said the bird, who had by this
time perched itself on the nose of one of the
little round poles that stuck out near the caves
of the round white tent, “come forth at once,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And at this command the canvas wall of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>round white tent was parted by the very hands
of the one who had been jiggling it in his impatience
to put it aside; and, little by little, as
if he feared that those who slept might waken,
there appeared the funniest little old man in
all the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>First came his head, all white and smooth
and crowned by a queer round hat that came
to a point at the top. And his ears were
white, too, and so was his face, except for his
red, red lips and five curious spots of red—one
on his chin, one on his brow, one on each
cheek, and one on the tip of his long, funny
nose. He wore a collar that was all ruffled and
round and a baggy white suit, trimmed with
great polka-dot patches, that might have been
likened to very red apples, except for the fact
that half of them were blue.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come, come! Make haste there, Dan—if,
indeed, you are Diggeldy Dan,” cried the bird
from its perch on the little round pole.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Quite so, quite so,” chuckled the funny old
man. And, suiting himself to his words, he
made a quick skip into the open, danced three
steps to the left and three to the right, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>then, doffing his queer, sugar-loaf hat, made a
very grand courtesy in the direction of the bird,
saying as he did so:</p>

<p class='c012'>“At your service, little messenger.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, then you know who I am!” exclaimed
the one who had come out of the west. “But
I must be very sure. So tell me, if you can,
what rhymes with this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O, Dan, Dan, Diggeldy Dan.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Why,” answered the clown—for you must
have guessed that he was a clown—“Why,”
he repeated,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You are the courier from Too-Bo-Tan.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>But though the bird nodded in approval, as
if to say, “Yes, yes, that is correct,” it still
seemed reluctant to admit that the man was
really Diggeldy Dan. So it put its head first
to one side and then to the other, and puckered
its very blue brows, as if thinking up some
further test. And then it spoke again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Diggeldy Dan—if, indeed, you are Diggeldy
Dan—who was it told you the last line
of the rhyme?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“Why,” answered the clown with great
readiness, “it was the Pretty Lady with the
Blue-Blue Eyes. She came to me in a dream
last night—riding her White-White Horse
through the skies. She wakened me, or at
least I thought she did, by tickling my nose
with her slim little whip. She said: ‘To-morrow,
after the circus is over and the great
crowd has gone home to its supper, and after
the people of the circus have had their suppers
and are come back to the shady places in and
about the big and little tents, to read and to
tell their tales and take their ease, they will
all fall into a very deep sleep—that is, all but
Diggeldy Dan.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>And, at this, the clown paused to take a
much-needed breath; for he had become somewhat
excited in telling his story and, to speak
the truth, had quite forgotten to breathe
between sentences.</p>

<p class='c012'>But at a sign from the bird, he went on:</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘As for you, Dan, Dan, Diggeldy Dan,’
continued the Pretty Lady with the Blue-Blue
Eyes, ‘you will not go to sleep. Instead,
you are to hide in the round white tent that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>stands in the center of all the bigger tents,
and wait for the messenger who will come out
of the west.’ And then she told me the rhyme.
‘For to-morrow,’ she said, ‘you’ll have been a
clown for a hundred years and a day.’ Yes,
that was just what she said: ‘A hundred years
and a day.’ And so I have been. But, what
of that, my pretty bird? For see! I still can
dance as merrily and as lightly as any butterfly
that flits o’er the fields in the May!”</p>

<p class='c012'>As if to prove what he had said, the funny
old clown tripped off so very blithely and so
very fast that he bumped smack into one of
the red and golden wagons that stood in the
lee of the round white tent.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, ha!” said the bird, half to itself, and
hardly seeming to notice that the bump into
the wagon had sent the clown to the grass on
his back, “you will do, Diggeldy Dan; you
will do.”</p>

<div id='i_010'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_010.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>In a very twinkling there appeared the most beautiful circus lady one ever laid eyes upon. <em>Page <a href='#Page_10'>10</a>.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>And, with that, it flew from its perch at the
top of the little round pole, while in a very
twinkling, there appeared the most beautiful
circus lady one ever laid eyes upon—and with
her a White-White Horse right out of the sky.
So that, when Dan picked himself up, and,
lifting one foot, was just about to finish his
dance, his red-red lips fell very far apart and
his eyes became almost as large as the polka-dot
patches that covered his white, baggy suit.
Indeed, he presented so comical an appearance—standing
there with one foot in the air,
and I staring his visitor most out of countenance—that
the Lady leaned forward on her
White-White Horse and burst into so merry
a laugh that it sounded like all the silver tinkle bells
in the world.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why,” exclaimed Dan, when he had finally
found his voice and put down his foot, “you
are the Pretty Lady with the Blue-Blue Eyes!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, and the blue bird, too; for it was I,
all the while. And now, Diggeldy Dan, if you
will be so good as to come with me to the very
edge of Spangleland, I will tell you the message
from Too-Bo-Tan.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And so the Pretty Lady and the White-White
Horse, with Dan walking by their side,
passed slowly along between the big and little
tents, speaking not at all, while the clown kept
wondering what it was he was so soon to hear.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH DAN HEARS THE MESSAGE FROM TOO-BO-TAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> Now, when the Pretty Lady with the
Blue-Blue Eyes had reached the very
outer edge of Spangleland, she brought
her White-White Horse to a pause. And Diggeldy
Dan paused, too. There they stood,
forming a picture for all the world like one you
must have seen in a story book; only it was
much more wonderful than that could ever be.
For no artist could ever have quite caught the
blue in the Lady’s eyes, or the gold that lay in
her hair. For, oddly enough, her yellow curls
gleamed, though by this time the twilight had
come and the lights of the night begun to blink
and to wink, away off in the streets of the
town. Then the Pretty Lady began to
speak:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dan; for now I know you are Diggeldy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Dan; what is in this great, white tent that
stands so near where we stand?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why,” answered Dan, “there’s monkeys,
and lions, and tigers and things, and—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Quite so,” the Lady broke in. “It, then,
is the tent that we want. Now listen to me
with both your funny white ears and with all
your two twinkling eyes. For this is the
message from Too-Bo-Tan, to all the animals
of Spangleland: Beginning on the morrow and
on every day ever after, there is to come a wee
little hour in the twilight when all the monkeys,
and lions, and tigers, and things are to be
let out of their cages, allowed to dance and to
play and do as they will.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, oh, Pretty Lady, that will not do at
all,” burst in Diggeldy Dan. “Their cages are
locked, there’s no hour to spare, and—and
maybe they’d eat folks up!”</p>

<p class='c012'>But for answer the Lady only laughed—the
laugh that was so like the tinkle bells.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have no fear, Diggeldy Dan. All that has
been thought out by far wiser heads than yours.
You see, it was this way: Ever so long ago,
Too-Bo-Tan—who is the very biggest monkey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>in all the world—called a meeting of all the
animals in far-away Jungleland. And, when
they had gathered on the highest peak of the
mountains, where Too-Bo holds his wonderful
court, Too-Bo rose and made this very solemn
speech:</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘It was, as many of you know, the very
dearest wish of my honored father, Vargu, that
the day might come when something could be
done to make easier the lot of our fellow
animals who have so nobly sacrificed their
freedom and consented to spend their lives in
red and golden cages, that the children may
have their circus days. Of late, I have had my
learned counselors go into this matter very
thoroughly, and they have found, but yesterday,
written on the face of a great stone in the
depths of a certain cave in a certain mountain,
this remarkable decree:</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘“On the day when Diggeldy Dan has been
a clown for a hundred years and a day, as a
reward for the great joy that he has given little
children through all his merry life, he will be
granted the privilege of releasing all animals
from their cages at every setting of the sun.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“‘And so,’ continued Too-Bo-Tan, looking
out from under his bushy eyebrows, ‘this
meeting of all the animals has been called that
we may discover just who this Diggeldy Dan
may be, where he is, and, most important of
all, whether he has yet been a clown for a
hundred years and a day.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But,” interrupted Dan, as the Pretty Lady
reached this point in her story, “I’ve been
right here with the circus for ever and ever
and ever so long.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course, you have,” agreed the Lady,
“but, you see, Too-Bo-Tan had been so busy
with other matters that he didn’t know that
you had. But I knew. For I am the Fairy
of the Circus—the one who watches over all
the riders and all the clowns and all the people
of the big and little tents—the one who knows
just what each one of them does every single
day. And so, when Too-Bo had finished
speaking, I jumped to my feet and said that I
could find you in no time at all. Then we
waited until the hour should come when you
had been a clown for a hundred years and a
day. And, when it came, I at once called for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>my White-White Horse and, as you know,
came to you through the skies as you slept.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And now, for the hour grows late and you
will soon be needed in the very biggest tent, to
laugh and to dance and play all your pranks,
let us be quick. To-morrow, at half-past twilight—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“When—when do you say?” puzzled Dan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At half-past twilight,” repeated the Lady.
“Which reminds me that I have a watch for
you that you may be very sure of the hour—a
very precious watch, fashioned from the petals
of a great white flower, that never blossoms,
except when the twilight comes and then only
for a wee, short hour.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Even as she spoke, the Pretty Lady tugged
at a silver thread that lay in the maze of the
mane of her White-White Horse. And presently
there appeared, from the opposite side of
her snowy mount, the queerest-looking watch
that ever told time. It was as round as a
pancake, but not one-quarter as thick—indeed,
it seemed to have no thickness at all.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This,” said the Lady, as she unhooked the
thread, “is the Petal Watch. You are to keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>it tucked away in the peak of your round,
funny hat. And each evening, just at half-past
twilight, it will open and put forth its petals,
and then you will know it is time to let loose
the monkeys, and tigers, and lions, and things.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And as Dan, taking the watch, knelt down
to fold it away in the crown of his hat, there
came a great burst of music from the very
biggest of all the bigger tents. At the sound
of it the White-White Horse began to prance
and then—the Pretty Lady’s curls set flying by
the speed of his gallop—was off through the
night to the west.</p>

<p class='c012'>For a moment Diggeldy Dan made as if to
follow. Then he turned, and holding his hat
very tightly, as if fearing he might lose the
watch that was to be so useful on the morrow,
he skipped away toward the great tent from
whence the music came, singing as he ran.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH DAN RELEASES THE ANIMALS OF SPANGLELAND</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> As the sun sank to rest behind the tents
of Spangleland, on the day following
the visit of the Pretty Lady with the
Blue-Blue Eyes, it paused for a moment—as the
sun sometimes will—and shot one last, long,
lingering beam toward the little white tent
which, as you will remember, played a part in
the beginning of this tale. Had you been near
at the time—and possessed some knack at riding
sun beams—you might have mounted this
one and ridden straight through the wee open
place that served as a peep-hole for the wee
little eye when the blue bird was first seen in
the west. For it was through this tiny chink
that the sunbeam passed and, having gained
entrance, landed plump on the nose of Diggeldy
Dan.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Indeed, it came so suddenly that the clown—who
sat hunched over on the top of a gayly
painted box, lost in deep thought—mistook it
for a bright yellow bee and tried to brush it
aside. And then he saw his mistake and,
sitting up very straight, glanced upward to the
hole in the wall.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oho! Little sunbeam; so you’ve come to
remind me!” he cried. “Yes, yes. Now I
will put on my hat and wait for the Petal
Watch to tell me the time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As he did so he noticed that—just as
before—all those who were near him were quite
fast asleep. And, looking up and then down
the inside of the tent, at all the many clowns
that had been packed off to Slumberland, and
all the queer, colored thingamajigs and all the
odd do-dads that clowns always keep near, he
waited for a sign from the watch. He did
not wait long, for soon he felt something
tickling the top of his smooth white head and,
removing his hat ever so carefully, there he
saw—exactly as the Pretty Lady had promised—the
unfolding petals of a wonderful
flower.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“Surely, now,” reasoned Dan, “it must be
half-past twilight.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So, slipping down from the box, he tiptoed
in and out through the sleeping forms, passed
to the open space between the little white tent
and all the bigger tents, picked his way among
the gayly dressed men and the women who
drowsed in the chairs or lay stretched on the
grass and, once clear of them, skipped away as
fast as ever his two legs would carry him in
the direction of the great tent where lived the
monkeys, and tigers, and lions, and things.
Reaching its entrance, he spied all the keepers
leaning against the poles of the tent. But
they, too, were asleep—their chins buried deep
on their breasts. Then he advanced to the
very center of the vast circle, formed by all the
red and golden cages. And, at sight of this
funny old clown in the polka-dot suit, there
went up such a cry from the animals that, for
the moment, Diggeldy Dan was tempted to
skip away even faster than he had come. For
never had he heard any such shout, which—but
for the fact that the people of the circus
were in a very deep sleep—must have wakened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>every one of them. But the keepers slept on,
and soon Dan came to realize that the voices
were joining in a sort of chant. Putting his
head to one side he listened ever so intently;
and then a great smile broke over his face.
For gradually the chant took form. Yes, it was
quite distinct now. The animals were shouting,
in almost as many keys as there were voices:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dan, Dan, Diggeldy Dan,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dan, Dan, Diggeldy Dan.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>And, looking about from cage to cage, Dan
saw that all of the animals were standing, their
eyes shining, their faces flushed, their mouths
working gleefully in the song that sang his
name. Then, almost as quickly as it had
begun, the chant ended and all was as quiet as
the hush of the twilight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, well,” began Dan, making four
separate bows—one to the north, one to the
east, one to the south, and the last to the
west—“you seem to know who I am!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course we do,” answered the mighty
chorus. “You’re Dan, Dan, Diggeldy, Dan.
We’ve been expecting you the whole day.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“And who, if I may make bold to ask, told
you to expect me?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why,” came the shout, “it was a little
bird. A bird—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Never mind the rest,” interrupted Dan.
“I might have guessed, without asking. It
was the blue bird, of course. So we’ll lose no
time in retelling old stories, but get down to
business at once.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And—that he might not be accused of playing
favorites, in so far as which animal should
be the first to be let out of its cage—the old
clown put his feet together, raised himself to
the very tips of his toes, shut his eyes very
tightly, spun around exactly seven times and
then—with his eyes still closed—followed the
end of his long, funny nose, until it had
brought him to the door of that cage which
was nearest it. And, opening the door and his
eyes at the very same moment, Diggeldy Dan
came face to face with—Lion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Lion,” said Dan, as he took one of the big
fellow’s paws in both his hands, “I am sure
that this nose of mine showed extremely good
sense in leading me first of all to your door.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>And now we will take the cages as they
come.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So Dan, accompanied by Lion, went to the
gilded home of Tiger; then the three of them
passed on to that occupied by Leopard—and
so, on around the great circle, until every single
one of the animals had been loosed from its
cage. With Dan in the lead, they formed a
long, winding line and then—the serpentine
entirely complete—moved forward, for all the
world like a troupe of children playing at lock
step. Round and round they marched, swaying
from side to side and singing at the very tops
of their voices, with Dan tossing his head from
right to left, like the drum-major in a band, and
holding out the sides of his baggy white trousers,
just as clowns ofttimes do at the circus.</p>

<p class='c012'>But after the strange procession had paraded
three times around the circle, Dan signaled a
halt.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No! No! Let’s do it some more,” pleaded
all the animals. And, though he was somewhat
out of breath, Dan gave consent and off
they all pranced again, making more of a din
than before. But, at the farther end of the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>tent, the old clown clapped his hands and the
long line stopped in its tracks. And doffing
his round, funny hat, Dan saw that the Petal
Watch was all but closed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Quick! Quick! There! Into your cages
or we’ll all be caught!” he cried. “Monkey,
you will go in last and, meantime, help me
close all the doors.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And, with Dan scurrying about and Monkey
running so very fast that he fastened two doors
to the old clown’s one, the task was completed
in no time at all.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now,” said Dan, after Monkey had been
tucked away, “I’ll say good-by till to-morrow.
And then, at half-past twilight, I’ll come again
and we’ll hold a great meeting and lay all
manner of plans. In the meantime, remember,
not a word to a soul.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not a word to a soul,” echoed the animals
in chorus.</p>

<p class='c012'>So, swinging his hat as he went, Diggeldy
Dan danced down the length of the menagerie
tent and then, stopping at the end of it to give
a last wave to his friends, disappeared in the
depths of the dusk.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH THE ANIMALS ELECT OFFICERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> On as fine an evening as one might wish
for and at exactly seven minutes past
half-past twilight by the Petal Watch,
Diggeldy Dan stood in the very center of the
great menagerie tent, while before him were
grouped all the animals of Spangleland.</p>

<p class='c012'>Coming from their cages and from out their
corrals or, like Elephant, Zebra, and Camel,
being unhooked from their chains by Monkey
and Dan, they had arranged themselves much
as one sees them pictured in great atlases or on
gayly colored posters, but never, strangely
enough, at the circus itself.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the front row sat Puma, Monkey, Seal,
Leopard, Hyena, and Little Black Bear, and
all their families. Next in order came Lion,
Tiger, Ostrich, Great White Bear, Deer, Emu,
Kangaroo, and their families; while, ranged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>behind these were Elephant, Camel, Hippo,
Zebra, and Rhino, and their different cousins
and aunts, with Giraffe and his folks still back
of them.</p>

<p class='c012'>There they sat, chattering and laughing and
making quite as much of a clatter as people
do at the theater, just before the curtain goes
up.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now,” began Dan, pulling his hands from
his pockets and clapping them together for
silence, “it seems to me the first thing to do is
to get ourselves organized.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, yes, that is it,” answered the merry
crew. “Let’s do that very thing!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We should begin, then,” continued Dan,
“by choosing a chairman. Who, say you,
shall it be?”</p>

<p class='c012'>At this all the animals began to talk at once;
but, as it was Tiger who seemed to be making
the most noise, Dan said he should be the first
to speak.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Diggeldy Dan and fellow animals,” said
Tiger, as he gravely stroked his chin with a
huge paw, “I rise to name one who, because of
the very place that he has long held among us,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>is especially suited to the office of chairman.
One who, because of his great strength, his
fairness, and kindly disposition, has long been
known as ‘the King of Beasts.’ The one who—as
you will remember—was the very first to be
loosed from his cage. I, of course, am speaking
of—Lion.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hear! Hear!” came from all sides. “Lion,
of course! Who else but Lion!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let’s make the choice unanimous,” cried
Rhino. And so, somewhat flustered, but by no
means lacking in dignity, and escorted by
Great White Bear and Little Black Bear,
Lion came forward to accept the office to
which he had been elected.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My fellow animals,” he said, “realizing
that there is still much to be done, I will be
brief. First, let me thank you for the honor
you have bestowed upon me and to assure you
that I will do my best to serve you. While
appreciating Tiger’s kindness in suggesting me
for chairman, I cannot but feel that I should
differ with him on one point—that is, with
reference to the title ‘the King of Beasts.’
That is all very well in Jungleland, perhaps,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>but here in this great land of the free—with
even ourselves set at liberty—I feel that the
word ‘king’ should be replaced by ‘president.’
I believe that—”</p>

<p class='c012'>But here cries of, “That’s right—Why, of
course—President of Beasts!” and the like
broke in upon the speaker, and the point was
carried, even before Lion had finished his argument.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, then, Mr. King—I mean Mr. President,”
said Hippo, who had been holding a
quiet consultation with the animals nearest
him, “it would seem to me that we should elect
a secretary before we go any further, so that an
exact record may be kept of these meetings
and, in due time, sent on to our good friend,
Too-Bo-Tan.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A very commendable thought, indeed,”
assented Lion. “Nominations are, therefore,
in order for secretary.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And, at this, the several animals who had
had their heads together with Hippo all
jumped to their feet and began to chant:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dan, Dan, Diggeldy Dan,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dan, Dan, Diggeldy Dan!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“Why, of course,” agreed all the rest. “Who
else but Diggeldy Dan!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll furnish a quill for the pen,” said
Ostrich.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know where there’s an old circus poster
with nothing at all on the back,” cried Elephant,
as he made off toward the end of the tent.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll offer myself for a table,” volunteered
Hippo.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I’ll supply the ink,” said Dan, diving
into one of his funny deep pockets and drawing
forth a top, some chalk, three marbles, and—last
of all—a bottle of very red ink.</p>

<p class='c012'>And so, almost before one might have said
Jack Robinson, there sat Diggeldy Dan astride
Hippo’s back with the poster that Elephant
had brought spread out before him, the quill
that Ostrich had furnished grasped firmly in
his hand, writing away for all he was worth,
while all the animals crowded around, all talking
at once and each trying to remember just
exactly what Tiger had said when he had
nominated Lion and just what Lion had said
when he spoke in reply.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course, all this took some little time and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>indeed, Dan concluded the first chapter of the
interesting document with one eye to his work
and the other on the Petal Watch. And, just
as he had crossed the very last “t” and dotted
the very last “i” the great white flower began
to close. At the first sign of it, away scampered
all the animals to their cages and corrals while
Dan, with the aid of Monkey, having locked
all the doors and fastened each chain, scurried
off to make ready for the circus, folding the
precious poster and tucking it away with the
Petal Watch as he ran.</p>

<p class='c012'>“To-morrow at half-past twilight,” he cried
in farewell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“To-morrow,” answered Lion, from the
depths of his cage, while from all parts of the
tent came the voices that echoed—“To-morrow—to-morrow—to-morrow.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH GIRAFFE GIVES A CHALK-TALK AND THE ANIMALS LEARN A NEW GAME</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> Now when the fourth day had turned to
twilight and the animals of Spangleland
had gathered to continue the meeting
that had resulted in the election of Lion as
President of Animals and Diggeldy Dan as
Secretary, Zebra announced that he had a
matter of much importance to bring to their
attention.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It has to do with Giraffe and his folks,”
began Zebra, as he bobbed his head and flopped
his long, striped ears in the direction of those
to whom he referred. “As all of us are aware,
neither Giraffe nor any of his ancestors have
ever been known to speak. When we consider
the great amount of talking many of us ofttimes
do without really saying much, I am
sometimes of the opinion that our big-eyed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>brothers show no little wisdom by preserving
strict silence. Still I feel that Giraffe and his
family should have a voice in our different
discussions, if they so desire, and think it
only fair that they be consulted as to their
wishes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>While Zebra had been speaking, it was
noticed that Giraffe had been all attention and,
when Lion from his place in front of all the
animals, asked him if he had anything to say,
he nodded most positively.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very well, then, Giraffe; we will, indeed,
be glad to hear from you,” said Lion, as he
crossed his paws and leaned back in an attitude
of strict attention.</p>

<p class='c012'>By this time, all the eyes of all the animals
were on Giraffe. And so were those of Diggeldy
Dan, who sat astride Hippo, the circus
poster spread out before him, his pen poised in
mid-air, ready to jot down any and all things
that might come to pass.</p>

<p class='c012'>And, as they watched, Giraffe unfolded his
long, lanky legs and, for all the world like two
boys on two pairs of tall stilts, made his way
from the rear of the group and walked around
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>to the side of Diggeldy Dan. Then, bending
his mile-long neck, he thrust his nose into the
depths of Dan’s pocket.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here, here!” cried the clown, “there are
no carrots there!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Silence, Dan!” commanded Lion.</p>

<p class='c012'>Even at this moment, Giraffe removed his
nose and there, in the tips of his lips, was the
top which, as you may remember, the clown
had drawn out when he brought forth the
bottle of very red ink. Down went the top on
the broad back of Hippo and back went
Giraffe’s nose in the pocket of Dan. And,
this time, the searcher’s ears began to wiggle
with delight and his eyes to twinkle with glee.
For when his nose next came forth there, held
tight in his mouth, was a piece of bright
yellow chalk.</p>

<p class='c012'>At sight of it a puzzled look crossed the
faces of all those who watched. It was Lion
who first caught the thought.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, of course!” he exclaimed, with a
wise nod of his head. “Giraffe proposes to
talk with the chalk.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“With the chalk, to be sure,” agreed Puma,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“and I know where there’s a board. The
inner side of the strips that close up my cage
are all painted black. Come on, Elephant, and
we’ll get one right now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So away the two of them went, and soon
Elephant was holding the board high up in
his trunk. And, as he held it in place, Giraffe
wrote with the chalk:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very thoughtful of you—Thanks—Heartily
agree with all done thus far—Giraffe.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And, putting the chalk alongside the top,
he made a low swinging bow with his long
spotted neck and hurried off to his place at the
rear of the group, amid the shouts and the
cheers of his fellows.</p>

<p class='c012'>While the animals were cheering or telling
one another just what each had been thinking
when Giraffe was rummaging Dan’s pocket, the
old clown’s pen was going “scratch, scratch,
scratch” back and forth across the poster.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And now, Mr. President,” said Dan, as he
finished writing and folded up the great sheet
of paper, “I suggest that we forget business
for a time and engage in a game that I have
in mind.”</p>

<div id='i_035'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_035.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Away they all went, down through the line. <em>Page <a href='#Page_35'>35</a>.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“A fine idea,” agreed Lion as, indeed, did all
the rest in one voice; that is, all but Giraffe
and his folks. They nodded their approval.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s a game called ‘London Bridge is
Falling Down,’” went on Dan. “It was
Giraffe’s long neck and Elephant’s trunk that
suggested the thought. So now, suppose we
begin.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, let’s begin,” cried the animals, as
they trooped into the circle that ran in front of
all the red and gold cages.</p>

<p class='c012'>“First,” called Dan, “you, Giraffe, and your
folks will stand opposite one another, with
your noses touching. There! That’s the way.
Now, Elephant, you and your family will do
the same, only raise your trunks very high and
hold them together at the tips—just as if you
were shaking hands way up in the air. That’s
it. Fine! Now all the rest of us will go
skipping down the aisle between you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So Dan, taking the lead and calling, “Come
on, Tiger! Come on, Lion! Hi there, Hippo,”
away they all went, down through the line.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, back again!” shouted Dan, “and
this is the song that we’ll sing as we go:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“London Bridge is falling down,</div>
      <div class='line'>Falling down, falling down,</div>
      <div class='line'>London Bridge is falling down,</div>
      <div class='line'>Down, down, down!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Say! Hold on a minute!” cried Hippo.
“I’m too wide! I can’t get through!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll fix that,” shouted Elephant. “Up,
now!” he commanded. And at the words,
all of Elephant’s folks stood up on their hind
legs and Hippo passed through without any
trouble at all. So the game went on, with all
the animals vowing that they never had had
quite so much fun before in all their lives.</p>

<p class='c012'>But, by this time, the Petal Watch had
begun to close; and, at a word from Dan and
the promise that he would see them again at
half-past twilight on the morrow, the merry
band went back to their places. As the old
clown passed out of the menagerie tent, he
could still hear the voices in the distance,
humming the song,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“London Bridge is falling down,</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH THE ANIMALS SEND A MESSAGE TO THE PRETTY LADY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> “And that,” finished Diggeldy Dan, “is
the story of the Pretty Lady with
the Blue-Blue Eyes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was on the fifth day after she of whom
Dan spoke had brought him the message from
Too-Bo-Tan and, with all the animals of
Spangleland gathered about him, the old
clown had been telling them of her and the
blue bird.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” nodded Camel, “she is the Fairy of
the Circus. I have heard my father describe
her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But I like the other name best,” spoke up
Seal. “‘The Pretty Lady with the Blue-Blue
Eyes!’ When my family and I go into the
great white tent to perform, we often catch a
glimpse of the riders as they pass on their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>way from the rings. They are much like
that—all pretty ladies with mounts like the
White-White Horse.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I wish we could see her,” mused Leopard.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let’s send her a message,” suggested
Ostrich.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But how?” queried Kangaroo. “We’ve
no one to send and, even if we had, where in
the world should we send him?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Diggeldy Dan,” said Lion, “what have
you to suggest?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” answered Dan, “I know this much:
and that is that the Pretty Lady went away
toward the west. I like to believe that she
makes her home in the sunset.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, if that’s the case, then that’s not
far from here,” broke in Elephant.</p>

<p class='c012'>Even while Elephant was speaking, Giraffe
came forward and picked up the chalk. Then,
striding to the side of a cage, he scrawled on
its face:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not far at all—looking through eaves space
in tent—this very evening—saw sun set just
back of hill—’bout a mile from here—Giraffe.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not more than a mile!” cried Tiger,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“Only a mile!” Then he paused and looked
rather foolish. For how were they to reach
over even a mile.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know, I know, I know!” shouted Monkey,
dancing up and down. “Balloons, balloons,
balloons! That’s the way! That’s the—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hold on there, Monkey,” interrupted Lion.
“Not so fast and, for goodness’ sake, don’t get
so excited. Besides, I, for one, know of no
balloons in this vicinity.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, no, I don’t mean truly big balloons,”
explained Monkey. “Wait a minute and I’ll
show you!” And away he dashed down the
menagerie tent and was back in a twinkling,
waving a great cluster of toy balloons over his
head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Monkey,” admitted Lion, as he took the
balloons, “I must confess that your head is
ofttimes much longer than mine. Of course,
you mean—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“To write our message, tie it to the balloons
and get the east wind to carry it over the hill
to the place where Giraffe saw the sun go
down,” finished Monkey.</p>

<p class='c012'>And then the excitement that followed!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>The writing of the message fell to Diggeldy
Dan and, after no end of changes—all, of
course, for the better—there appeared these
words written on a corner that had been torn
from the great circus poster:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dear Pretty Lady with the Blue-Blue Eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>At Sunset House, just over the hill:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“We all want you to visit us. We all promise to be
very quiet.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Please come at half-past twilight, to-morrow.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(Signed) “Animals of Spangleland,</div>
      <div class='line'>“By: Diggeldy Dan, Secretary.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“P. S.—Please bring back the balloons, because they
are just borrowed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“P. S.—The White-White Horse is invited, too.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The message completed, Diggeldy Dan produced
a piece of string from one of his wonderful
pockets and, aided by Monkey, tied all the
sticks of all the balloons tightly together and
then fastened the letter to the tip of the sticks.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, then,” said Lion, “we are ready to
let loose the balloons. You, Elephant, take
hold of the sticks with your trunk. You,
Puma, will leap to the top of your cage and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>hold open the eaves of the tent with your
paws so that Elephant can thrust the balloons
through the space and hand them to the wind
as it comes out of the east.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can make out the curve of a hill to the
west,” called Puma, who had jumped from the
ground to the roof of the cage. “Only I can’t
get quite high enough to see over the top.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll be the lookout,” cried Monkey, “that
is, if Giraffe will lend me his head and step
over near the eaves of the tent.” And, as
Giraffe nodded assent, up the long neck he
scampered and was soon perched aloft, holding
tight with both hands to Giraffe’s pointed
ears.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All right, up there?” called Lion from
below.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All ready,” answered Monkey, “and here
comes the east wind around the side of the
tent.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Cast off, then, Elephant,” commanded
Lion. “Let go the balloons!”</p>

<p class='c012'>At the very same moment, Elephant gave a
great “swish” with his trunk and away went
the balloons through the space at the eaves.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“There they go!” shouted Monkey. “Up,
up, up! Goodness, how they’re sailing! Oh!
they’ve caught in a tree! No, they haven’t!
Now the east wind has them again! Once more
they’re off! They’re going higher and higher!
And they’re bound straight for the hill! Yes,
straight for the brow of the hill!”</p>

<p class='c012'>And so, from his perch, Monkey described
every inch of the flight until, to the great
relief of the animals who were grouped down
below, he announced that the balloons had
passed over the hill.</p>

<p class='c012'>Indeed the word came in good time, for
just then there followed a quick shout from
Dan, crying, “Get back to your places as fast
as you can!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then came a wild scurrying to right and to
left.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, I’ll bid you good night,” said Diggeldy
Dan, when the very last door had been
locked. “And to-morrow we’ll learn if we
were right when we guessed that the one we
have written makes her home in the west.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH THE ANIMALS MEET WITH A DISAPPOINTMENT AND A SURPRISE AND A STORY IS BEGUN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> Now, had the keepers who slept so
soundly at the foot of the big blue
poles in the great menagerie tent suddenly
wakened at a little after half-past twilight
on the evening following that which saw
the balloons go sailing over the hill, they no
doubt would have rubbed their eyes, pinched
themselves and then exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, of all things! Wherever can those
animals be?”</p>

<p class='c012'>But, of course, they did nothing of the kind,
for the very good reason that not a single one
of them so much as opened one eye. Though,
if they had, where do you suppose they would
have found all their charges? Away over
behind the red and gold cages.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Yes, there they stood, side by side in a row,
their noses pressed close against the west
wall of the tent, looking for all the world like
so many “catchers” in a game of hide-and-go-seek.
And Diggeldy Dan was there, too. All
had found peep-holes in the canvas and
through these they peered eagerly in the
direction of Sunset House. They were watching
for the Lady with the Blue-Blue Eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Every one to his place,” Lion had commanded,
when the merry crew had been loosed,
but a few moments before. “And then we
will see who will be the first to catch a glimpse
of the one who will ride out of the west. Not
a word from a soul, until she comes into view.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At first it was fun, but, as the minutes
dragged by and no movement was seen, the
watchers began to grow restless. Seal started
to twist and to turn. Next, Puma’s tail was
seen to curl and to wave; while Zebra switched
his with quick little jerks. Then Hippo heaved
a great sigh that must surely have been heard
a whole mile away. Finally, Monkey, who
was never known to keep entirely quiet, could
stand it no longer.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“Lion,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c012'>No answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Lion,” repeated Monkey.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, what is it?” answered Lion at last,
from his place near the middle of the line.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I—I don’t want to watch any longer.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Have patience and be quiet, sir,” ordered
Lion.</p>

<p class='c012'>So the watch went on. A minute passed,
and another, and another. Then something
went, “Bang!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What was that?” demanded Lion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I—I was standing on my tail and—and
went to sleep,” answered Kangaroo, in a very
sheepish voice. “I—I fell down and bumped
my head against Rhino’s cage.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And it was newly varnished but yesterday,”
muttered Rhino.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then Monkey giggled and that set Hyena to
laughing until the tears rolled down his cheeks.
Even Lion was obliged to smile though, a
moment later, his face took on a very serious
look.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps we have waited long enough,”
he admitted, rather sadly. “I fear something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>must have happened. What do you think,
Diggeldy Dan?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t know just what to say, Lion,”
answered Dan. “You see, I was quite sure
the Pretty Lady made her home in the west.
It is all my fault. I am very sorry.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There, there,” said Lion, as he placed a
paw on the old clown’s shoulder. “Surely,
none of us would think of blaming you,
Dan.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So come,” he called out to the rest, “let
us go to the center of the tent; for we will
watch no longer to-day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Once they knew they might leave their
places, the animals were less eager to do so.
For they suddenly realized how disappointed
they were now that they were not to see the
Pretty Lady with the Blue-Blue Eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now,” began Lion, after all had been
seated, and doing his best to speak gayly,
“I suggest that we—”</p>

<p class='c012'>But what it was Lion had in mind no one
ever came to know; for, just at that moment,
he was interrupted by a pattering shower of
silvery rain! The shimmering flecks fell everywhere,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>round the animals, on their heads and
on their backs.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What in the world is this?” exclaimed
Lion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, they’re spangles!” cried Elephant,
who had picked up some of the bits with the
tip of his trunk.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Spangles, sure enough,” agreed Diggeldy
Dan, “though I never saw any as bright nor
have I ever known spangles to come out of the
sky.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But they can’t have come from the sky,”
reasoned Tiger; “for how could they have
passed through the roof of the tent?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, as if to prove Tiger wrong, there
came a second and even greater shower than
before. This time there were so many spangles
that they fairly tinkled as they fell, while
mingling with their tinkling was a rippling
laugh that sounded like silver bells played all
in a row. And, of all marvelous things, the
voice came from the depths of the great red
and golden home that belonged to Giraffe!</p>

<p class='c012'>Instantly, all eyes were turned toward the
house on the wheels. At the very same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>moment its doors swung apart and there,
framed by the opening, stood the Pretty Lady
with the Blue-Blue Eyes!</p>

<p class='c012'>Even as the animals stared in open-mouthed
wonder, their golden-haired visitor threw back
her head and laughed until from her eyes
came tears, as glistening as the spangles that
dotted the ground. Then she stopped quite as
suddenly as she had begun, and, putting her
left foot behind her and the tip of one finger to
the tip of her chin, made so graceful a courtesy
that all the animals found themselves trying to
do the very same thing, though it must be
confessed that some of them made a rather
awkward job of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>As for Diggeldy Dan, he made the very
grandest bow that any clown ever made,
while, taking his cue from Dan, Lion put one
paw to his heart and said in very solemn
tones:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dear Lady, we one and all bid you welcome,
though how you got here we are at an
entire loss to know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why,” answered the Pretty Lady, as she
tripped from the doorway to where Lion stood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>“I came in under the wall near the end. I
went right past your nose, Kangaroo; in fact,
I think you were napping.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And, at that, you may be sure a certain
animal looked very foolish.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then,” she continued, “I hid in Giraffe’s
house and, after you were seated, began tossing
spangles through the window near the top.
You see I always carry a bag of them that I
may sprinkle the sunset whenever I pass.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So you do live at Sunset House,” said
Diggeldy Dan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just over the hill, where the sky turns to
pink. The balloons and the message came in
through my window last night.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Goodness! You didn’t forget to bring
them back, did you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Monkey!” cried Lion reprovingly, for you
might have guessed who had spoken.</p>

<p class='c012'>But the Lady only laughed at the question.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed, I did not,” she replied; and with
that she gave three quick claps with her hands,
while from somewhere in galloped the White-White
Horse. And there, clasped to a buckle
of his snowy trappings, were the balloons that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>had gone over the hill. Soon they were taken
to where Monkey had found them; but, alas,
the next moment the Lady had leaped to her
place and was gone down the tent like a shot!</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, no!” cried all the animals. “Please,
please don’t go away.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, please don’t,” wailed Monkey. “I
didn’t mean to be rude when I asked about
the balloons.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m not going away,” the Lady laughed
back. “I’m just combing my hair, and the
mane and the tail of my White-White Horse.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And around the great circle the two of them
sped; then stopped in front of the animals again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You see,” said the Lady, as she tossed
back her curls, “combs and brushes are so
much bother that we never carry them, but
just let the rush of the wind take their place.
But now that is done, pray tell me why you
sent for me and what I’m to do?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tell us a story,” cried Ostrich.</p>

<p class='c012'>“About Too-Bo-Tan,” suggested Little Black
Bear.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, yes!” chimed all the rest, “about
Too-Bo-Tan.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“Very well,” nodded the Lady; and, leaning
forward on the back of the White-White
Horse, with her chin cupped in one hand, she
began:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Many years ago—so very many that there
are not enough stripes on Zebra’s sides, nor yet
on his ears, to count them—there lived in far-away
Jungleland a very wise monkey, named
Vargu. In those days the different animals
mingled not at all, each being content to keep
solely to the company of his very own kind.
Now, one day, this monkey named Vargu was
seated in the fork of a tree, quite lost in deep
thought, when a leopard trotted by underneath.
Spying the leopard—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Pretty Lady, Pretty Lady,” Diggeldy Dan
interrupted.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dan!” cried Lion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But the Watch, the Petal Watch—it’s
closing!” answered the clown in despair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Goodness, so it is,” echoed the Lady.
“But you shall not miss the story, for I will
come again on the morrow. With the twilight
I’ll come—until then fare you well.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And with that she was gone like a flash
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>through the dusk, while the animals all hurried
back to their places, each wondering what it
was they were to hear the next day of the very
wise monkey named Vargu.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH THE PRETTY LADY CONTINUES HER STORY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> Hidden away in the folds of that
mantle called twilight which, as every
one knows, is laid over the earth with
every setting of the sun, is a wee little hour
that is fairly made for the telling of stories.
And to those of Spangleland who know how
to find it—though none save they who possess
the Petal Watch will ever learn how—there
is a very minute which marks the beginning of
half-past twilight. And that is the best time of
all.</p>

<p class='c012'>With its coming the blue of the tent-poles
seems to grow a shade softer and the great,
rope-fretted roof and the lazy, breeze-wafted
walls melt from white into gray. It is then
that the red and gold cages slyly gleam from
their places in the circle they form, and, most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>wonderful of all, then that every door opens,
thanks to good Too-Bo-Tan.</p>

<p class='c012'>And on this particular evening of which you
are to hear, you may be sure that the funny
old clown in the polka-dot suit—that’s Diggeldy
Dan—and the chattering brown fellow
with the twinkling brown eyes—Monkey, of
course—had loosed all the animals much faster
than ever before. The reason? You’ve guessed
it—the promised story from the Pretty Lady
with the Blue-Blue Eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>Hardly had the animals taken their places,
when there came the sound of hoof-beats
mingling with the laugh that was so like to
tinkle bells, and into the circle galloped the
White-White Horse, bearing the one for whom
they all waited.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A merry twilight!” she cried, as the two
came to a stop in front of the group.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A merry twilight to you,” answered Lion;
and then all the rest added their voices in
greeting while Dan, skipping to the side of the
White-White Horse, offered his round, pointed
hat as a cup to receive the Pretty Lady’s foot
that he might assist her to alight. This she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>accepted as quick as a wink and, tossing her
slim, little whip and the bag with the spangles
to the broad back of Hippo, made a quick
little run and a quick little bound, twitched
her toe-tips together just as riders always do at
the circus, and then ran straight to the seat in
the midst of the animals.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now,” said she, “if you will pay the
strictest attention, I’ll go on with the story.
But, first, who will tell me just how it began?”</p>

<p class='c012'>At this all the animals talked at one time
and there arose such a din that the Pretty
Lady put her two hands to her ears in direst
despair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Order! Order!” shouted Lion. “Gracious,
what a racket! Giraffe, since you were the
only one who remained silent, you may tell us
the first part of the tale.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So Giraffe took the chalk and, going to the
side of his house, wrote these words:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Many years ago—that time animals mixed
with own folks only—wise monkey—Vargu by
name—thinking—in tree—Leopard passes underneath—Signed:
Giraffe.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Exactly,” cried the Lady. “You see, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>very wise monkey named Vargu had been
sitting there wondering why it was that the
different kinds of animals could not be more
sociable. So, when the leopard came in sight,
what do you suppose Vargu did? A most
unheard of and a most daring thing—he spoke
to him! Now at first the leopard, whose name
was Soft Foot, could not believe his ears, so he
kept straight on his way. But Vargu was
determined. He spoke once again. And with
that, the leopard stopped full in his tracks and
gazed at the monkey in utter amazement.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Why, What does this mean!’ he called up
to the other. ‘You cannot speak to me. You
are a monkey.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Ah,’ answered Vargu, ‘but I can speak to
you even if I am a monkey. And, if you don’t
believe it, just listen to this: Hello, Mister
Leopard! Hello! Hello! Hello!’ And, with
that, he went scampering to the very top of
the tree.</p>

<p class='c012'>“For a moment Soft Foot made as if to
spring into the tree. But he finally contented
himself with blinking his eyes in a dazed sort
of way, and then making off through the maze
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>of the grass, shaking his head as he went.
Yet, try as he would, he could not forget what
had happened. He thought of it as he was
going to sleep and he thought of it when he
wakened. Then curiosity got the better of
him and the next afternoon found him trotting
along beneath the very same tree. And there,
as before, sat the monkey called Vargu.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Hi there, Mister Leopard; glad to see you
again,’ shouted the monkey from his place up
above. ‘Better stop and visit a while. I
know a mighty fine story.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘I don’t want to hear it,’ snarled Soft
Foot. ‘Besides, as I warned you yesterday,
leopards and monkeys can’t speak to one
another. Leopards talk to leopards and that’s
enough.’ And away he went through the
grass.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, that very same night, when all the
leopards were gathered together, Great Spot,
the biggest of them all, began to tell one of his
stories. Some of the baby leopards were
interested, but as for Soft Foot, he had heard
the tale so many times that he knew it by
heart. So, putting his nose between his paws,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>he lay with his thoughts far away. He was
thinking of the monkey who lived in the tree.
‘He wanted to tell me a story,’ mused Soft
Foot. ‘I wonder what it was about.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so, though leopards never, never had
anything to do with any animals except their
very own kind, it somehow happened that the
following evening found Soft Foot trotting
along under the same tree again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There sat the monkey but, to Soft Foot’s
surprise, he spoke not a word. So the leopard
moved on to the deep grass beyond. But,
after a moment, he walked back again. And
still the monkey uttered never a sound. For a
third time he passed and then Soft Foot could
stand the silence no longer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Well,’ he blurted, ‘aren’t you going to say
anything?’</p>

<div id='i_059'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_059.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“Then he picked up his left foot and began to use its toes for counters.” <em>Page <a href='#Page_59'>59</a>.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“Now, at this precise moment the monkey
called Vargu did a far more daring thing than
he had done when he first spoke to Soft Foot.
He made a great swing from the branch where
he sat and landed plump under his visitor’s
nose! With a start of surprise, the leopard
crouched back and for a moment he made as
if he were going to leap off through the grass.
Had he done so, I’m sure I don’t know what
might have come of this tale. Indeed, I’m
afraid there might have been none to tell. For
who knows but what, failing at this very time,
Vargu might never have accomplished his
plan. But, without so much as moving one
inch from the point he had reached on the
ground when he swung, he calmly sat down
and at once began to count on his toes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘One, two, three, four, five, six, seven’
(long breath) ‘eight, nine, ten—Dear me!
I wonder if I’m going to have enough,’
exclaimed he to himself, just as if there
wasn’t another animal for miles and miles
around. Then he picked up his left foot and
began to use its toes for counters all over
again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“By this time Soft Foot had quite swallowed
his snarl and, if he had been a house-cat
instead of a leopard, there is no telling what
might have happened to him. For he was
simply overcome with curiosity.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,’ continued
Vargu.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“‘For goodness’ sake, fourteen what!’ broke
in Soft Foot.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Why,’ answered Vargu, looking up, ‘stories,
of course. Fifteen, sixteen—’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Do you mean to say you known that
many stories?’ demanded the leopard, again
interrupting.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Of course I do,’ replied the other, ‘but,
since leopards can’t talk to monkeys, you
wouldn’t be interested. Nineteen, twenty—’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘But I am interested,’ protested Soft Foot.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Of course you are,’ said Vargu as he
dropped his foot and ceased counting, ‘and I
know that you know a whole lot of tales in
which I would be interested. More than that,
we both know that all the different kinds of
animals know stories that they might tell one
another, if they only would; and be a lot
happier and a lot more sociable as a result.
So, why in the world don’t we all get acquainted
and be friends?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘We just can’t,’ answered Soft Foot. ‘It
isn’t done.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘But we two are doing it, aren’t we?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Y—es,’ admitted the other slowly.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“‘Well,’ argued Vargu, ‘what we two can do
all the animals can do, if they only will. And
I have a plan that I am sure will succeed.
What do you say—will you help me?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“The leopard sat thinking for fully a minute.
Then he walked up and down several times
beneath the tree.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Aw, come on,’ coaxed Vargu.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘There’s my paw on it, monkey,’ the other
said finally. ‘My name’s Soft Foot.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Mine’s Vargu,’ the monkey answered gleefully,
‘V-a-r-g-u with the u silent, please. And
now suppose we climb into the tree so we can
talk undisturbed.’”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH THE PRETTY LADY CONCLUDES HER STORY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> Once seated above, each told the other
his favorite story and, these being finished,
the leopard asked to hear of
Vargu’s secret plan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘You shall have it at once,’ the other
declared. And with that he sounded a soft,
signaling note, while from somewhere appeared
a solemn-eyed monkey who was almost the
image of Vargu.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘This,’ said the latter, ‘is my son, Too-Bo-Tan.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Pleased to meet you,’ said Soft Foot
admiringly. ‘A mighty fine lad, sure enough.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Yes,’ agreed Vargu, With some pride in
his tone, ‘and, even though I say it who
shouldn’t, the very nimblest monkey in all
Jungleland. Indeed, that is why I have made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Too-Bo a part of the plan. So now, if you’ll
both draw as close as ever you can, I’ll tell
you what we’re to do.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just what was said, I’m sure I don’t know.
But there was no end of whispering, all of
which argued that some deep dark plan was
afoot that, doubtless, would be made known in
good time.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, on the following night,” the Pretty
Lady continued, “a very odd thing came to
pass. For, from the tops of the trees in many
parts of Jungleland, sounded a weird, mournful
voice crying these words:</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Great rock near the desert’s edge—great
rock near the desert’s edge—rock—rock—rock!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“All the animals heard the strange cry and
some sprang into the trees to learn who had
made it. But, by the time they had done so,
the voice was far, far away, repeating the
words like an echo.</p>

<p class='c012'>“On the very next night, and at the very
same hour, the cry came again. With the
speed of the wind it passed through the trees,
wailing:</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“‘Great rock near the desert’s edge—watch
the hole in its face—hole in its face—face—face—face!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“Following this second message there was
no other topic in all Jungleland. The different
families discussed it for hours; but not even
the wisdom of Black Mane, the mightiest of
all the lions, could solve the riddle. Of course,
all knew of the rock—a huge wall of stone
with a face as smooth as our own Hippo’s
back. Some sent scouts to examine it. All
returned with the very same word—there was
not a sign of a hole to be found.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, on the third night, the mysterious
voice came again. It was here, there—everywhere
at once so it seemed. And, as it passed
on its way, these words were framed by its cry:</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Rock near the desert’s edge—watch the
hole in its face at midnight to-night—at midnight
to-night—to-night—to-night—to-night!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“Excitement was everywhere. Jungleland
resounded with the cries of animal chiefs,
calling their followers about them. And,
forming into bands, each separate group began
moving toward the great rock. Out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>forests and from the waste places they came—in
herds, in troupes and in pairs. But each
kind kept to itself and, reaching the ground
that stretched from the foot of the cliff,
remained as far apart from the others as the
width of the plain would allow.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The moon was on high and there were
millions of stars. Yet, though these lighted
the side of the rock, there was not a trace of a
hole to be seen. Still, it was not yet midnight;
so, with eyes fixed on the cliff, the strange
gathering awaited some sign. And, on the
very minute, it came!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, something was about to take place.
First, every ear heard a deep, muffled sound—like
a drum that is played far away. Next, a
wee stream of sand began to trickle down the
face of the rock; then a rattling of pebbles and
still larger stones; while, high up, near the
top of the cliff, there gradually appeared an
opening as round and as big as Elephant’s
foot.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not an animal dared breathe! Every eye
was alert—every muscle grew tense. Then,
from the very heart of the rock and out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>through the hole, came a voice that was almost
like thunder.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Who wants to hear a story?’ it roared.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But not one of the watchers made answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Who wants to hear a story?’ roared the
voice once again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then Great Spot, the leopard, took heart.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘We do,’ he replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘We, also,’ called Black Mane, while soon,
from all sides, came voices crying the same.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Then harken, one and all,’ roared the
voice from the rock.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, what the story was about need not
concern us just now,” continued the Lady.
“But there was a story—and oh, such an
interesting one. At times the listeners nudged
one another with delight, while the younger
animals found themselves exchanging knowing
glances with those they had never so much as
noticed before. But, as is often the contrary
way of those who tell tales, the voice that told
this one suddenly stopped at the most exciting
point in the story.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Tell us the rest,’ rose the cry from the
plain.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“‘To-morrow, at midnight,’ roared the face
of the cliff. ‘Come then, if you’d hear the
end of the tale.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now you may be sure that the following
night found all at the foot of the great rock
again. They were gathered together a full
hour before midnight and some spent the time
retelling the story. But not all told it alike,
and soon—of all unheard-of things—animals
who had never spoken to one another in all
their days found themselves appealing to
know if this or that were not the way the tale
had been told. Even as they debated, there
came a roar from the cliff and the unseen one
went on with the story. In time it was finished
and the great voice was stilled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Tell us another,’ cried all the animals
from their place on the plain.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But plead as they would, the voice came
no more. And, strangely enough, they never
heard it again. They returned to the plain the
very next night, but the hole in the great
rock had been closed. They waited until long
after midnight—but not one single sound came
to greet them. Never had there been such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>mystery and it was talked of for hours upon
hours and days upon days. Time after time
the animals came to the great rock and,
always, in quest of the voice that was stilled.
As they lingered, night after night, in the hope
that it might come again, the various animals
told their own favorite stories. And then,
little by little, the different ones began listening
to those that yet others told. This made for
friendships and, one memorable night, a certain
monkey made bold to suggest that at least
once every week some particular animal be
selected to tell one story to all. The thought
was approved and so, as time passed along,
this trysting place came to be known by a
name that is loved by every animal in Jungleland.
And what, do you suppose, is it called?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Story Time Rock,” spoke up Lion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, yes!” answered the Pretty Lady.
“But how did you know, Lion?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ve heard my grandfather tell of it. But
he always finished by saying there were none
who ever solved the mystery of the voice that
was stilled.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, no one ever did,” said the Lady.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“Yet, like so many things that are thought to
be mysteries, it was really simple enough.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then, for goodness’ sake, tell us the
secret!” cried Monkey, “for I’m just bursting
to know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, it was like this: Long before Vargu—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Watch! The Watch! The Petal
Watch!” broke in Diggeldy Dan. “A thousand
pardons, Pretty Lady, but it’s almost
closed!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So it is,” cried she, jumping to her feet.
“We’ve not a moment to lose.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Back to your places, every one of you,”
she added, as she bounded to her seat on the
White-White Horse, “until half after twilight
to-morrow, when I’ll come to tell you the
rest.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And with a hurried “Sleep tight” and a last
silvery laugh, she sped away toward her home
in the west.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER X<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH THE PRETTY LADY TELLS OF MYSTERIES AND SPANGLES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> “Well,” said Tiger, as he folded his
paws in a most complacent manner,
“I’m ready.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We, also,” declared Elephant, speaking for
his entire family, who, having formed a line,
were just at that moment swaying backward
and forward quite as if they were about to
glide into the graceful maze of a waltz.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So are all of us,” commented Lion, as he
surveyed the great group from his station
before it. “I wonder what can be keeping the
Pretty Lady?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps the White-White Horse is delayed
by the clouds,” suggested Elephant, as he
paused long enough to push back the wall near
the caves of the tent and peer into the dusk.
“I can make out whole crowds of them along
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>the streets of the sky. They have been there
all afternoon. It is always that way on
market days. Even the sun can scarcely find
its way.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How long do you suppose it has been since
half-past twilight began?” asked Emu of
Diggeldy Dan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, well,” said the clown, as he drew the
Petal Watch from the innermost depths of his
round, funny hat, “now that’s what I call
a question.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let me see,” mused he, setting his head on
one side, pursing his very red lips and half
shutting his two, twinkling eyes. “I should
say—though, mind you, I do not pretend to be
exactly correct—I should say it has been not
less than five hippo-yawns, nor yet more than
two cat-naps.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, surely, it must be longer than that,”
protested Monkey. “It seems an age to me.
I never saw such a watch, anyway. Now, if
it had behaved for but a minute more last
evening, we should all have known the secret
of the Story Time Rock.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Monkey, Monkey,” sighed Lion, “I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>afraid that you are of that queer set of folks
who are ever looking for a clock that will
travel both ways at one time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Both ways at one time!” exclaimed Monkey.
“Why, who ever spoke of any such
thing? I surely did not, for, of course no such
clock could possibly be.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, it could not,” answered Lion. “Yet,
I repeat, that is what you would like. For, in
one breath, you find fault with the Petal Watch
because it moved too swiftly last night, and in
the next you complain because it travels so
slowly to-day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Exactly,” chimed Dan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, I never stopped to think of it in just
that way,” admitted Monkey, as he scratched
his head, “and, besides—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Besides,” broke in the keen-eared Hyena,
“here comes the one for whom we’re all
waiting!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sure enough there resounded the patter of
oncoming hoofs and the next moment into
the menagerie tent galloped the White-White
Horse, carrying the Pretty Lady with the Blue-Blue
Eyes. Her pink cheeks made the pinker
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>by the speed of the ride, and her curls blown
straight back with the rush of the wind, she
drew up in front of the group.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was the clouds,” she explained. “There
were simply no end of them out shopping
to-day, and then any number waited to see
the sun go down. Of course, all had to have
spangles; and some of the baby clouds wanted
two helpings. That all took time, but—here I
am at last. See! the Spangle Bag is almost as
flat as Elephant’s ear.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where will you get enough spangles to fill
it again?” asked Camel.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll be glad to tell you, but, for the present,
one thing at a time. Remember, we have not
yet solved the mystery of the Story Time Rock.
Unless,” she hastened to add, “unless you have
guessed the riddle of the voice that was
stilled.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not one of us has,” answered Lion,
“though we are all convinced that Vargu was
pretty much at the bottom of the whole
strange affair.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He was, sure enough,” assented the Lady,
“and this was the way of it: Quite some time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>before he had made friends with Soft Foot
Vargu had discovered an all but hidden cave
with an entrance from the top of the cliff.
He had explored it repeatedly and so knew its
outer wall was almost worn through the face
of the rock. Now, as you may have guessed,
it was the nimble Too-Bo-Tan who passed
through the tops of the trees sending out the
strange cry that called all the animals together.
Meanwhile, Vargu had taught Soft
Foot a wonderful story. Finally, there came
the night when all the animals were gathered
at the foot of the cliff. And then, taking a
stone, Vargu pounded a hole through the wall
of the cave to the outer side of the rock.
Next, Soft Foot spoke to those on the great
plain below; and then he told them the story.
Of course, since he was telling it from the
hollow depths of the cave, his voice sounded
ever so big. And so there was really no
mystery at all.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Having gained his point—that of bringing
all the animals together—Vargu gave his time
to the meetings that were held on the plain.
As the years passed, Too-Bo-Tan succeeded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>his father and became the favorite among all
those who told tales at the Story Time Rock.
And finally he came to be a leader among
them; and is to this very day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Shall we ever see him?” asked Diggeldy
Dan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m sure I don’t know. Sometime, perhaps.
And now, one and all, a merry good night,
for I must hurry away to thread my spangle
needles and set them in place.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Spangle needles,” repeated Puma. “Pray,
what are they?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, what else but needles that catch the
spangles,” laughed the Pretty Lady, “which
reminds me that I was to tell you about them.
Here, Diggeldy Dan, take your place at the
head of my White-White Horse, while I
explain just how spangles are made.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You see,” she went on, as Dan skipped to
obey, “spangles are really nothing more than
dewdrops squeezed out very flat. As for a
supply—there’s no end; but to catch them’s
a trick requiring no little knack. Now it has
been my happy task to gather spangles for the
clouds, and for all the glittering hosts of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>own Spangleland for ever and ever and ever
so long. And this is the best way of all:
First, I take a great armful of needles—medium
sized moonbeams give the finest results—and
thread them with cobwebs. Next,
I plant them along the sides of my house
directly under the edge of the eaves, with
their heads in the ground and their sharp little
noses straight up in the air. Now, during the
night the dewdrops come to play on the roof
and many jump off to the garden below. And,
as they do, they land on the points of the
moonbeams. Down they come, never minding
in the least, for, if there is one thing that a
dewdrop would rather be than a dewdrop, it’s
a spangle. On and on they come, piling
one on the other, becoming very flat, very
shiny and very round, and then sliding on to
the threads. So, when morning comes, I take
the Spangle Bag, ‘snip’ the knots, and let the
spangles tumble and tinkle into its depths.
And so I always have enough to sprinkle the
sunset whenever I pass.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, that must be the way the rain gets
into the clouds!” cried Diggeldy Dan.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“It’s one of the ways,” smiled the Lady.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And the reason why spangles always have
a wee hole in the middle,” remarked Seal.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How wonderfully fortunate,” added Zebra.
“Otherwise, they couldn’t be sewed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I don’t see why you say that,” said
Kangaroo.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Say what?” asked Zebra.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, that they have to have holes to be
sowed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But they do.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Can’t see it,” persisted Kangaroo.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, how could one make them stay on?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just sow them, of course,” answered Kangaroo,
“toss them on.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, don’t be silly, Kangaroo,” said
Zebra, “you—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hold on a moment,” interrupted Lion.
“I think I see the point. Let me ask you,
Kangaroo: On what are you thinking of sowing
the spangles?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, I mean like when the Pretty Lady
sows them on the cloud banks when she rides
past,” replied Kangaroo.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And you, Zebra?” asked Lion.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“Camel’s plush robe, and costumes and
things,” said Zebra.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, you mean ‘s-e-w-e-d!’” cried Kangaroo.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, you mean ‘s-o-w-e-d!’” apologized
Zebra.</p>

<p class='c012'>And amid the laughter that followed Dan
assisted the Pretty Lady to the back of the
White-White Horse.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ll come again, some day?” asked
Lion, as the golden-haired one waved them a
smiling farewell.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Some day,” she replied. And, giving full
rein to her steed, she galloped down the
length of the tent. As the White-White
Horse nosed his way through the wall, the
animals caught a glimpse of the first dartling
beams of a far-distant star. The Pretty
Lady seemed to regard the beams for a
moment, as if trying to make up her mind
whether they would quite do for spangle
needles. Then the wall closed again and the
Lady, the White-White Horse and the star
passed from view, while all of the animals
hurried back to their places, still discussing the
spangles that were made from the dew.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH THE ANIMALS PLAY AT CIRCUS AND DAN PROMISES A STORY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> It was but a few evenings following that
upon which the Pretty Lady had set out
in quest of the spangle needles. Diggeldy
Dan had mounted to his place on Hippo’s
broad back, and Lion had taken his in front
of the group, when the clattering crew made
a startling discovery:</p>

<p class='c012'>Monkey was missing!</p>

<p class='c012'>Look where they would, he was nowhere to
be found; call as they would, he gave no
answering sound.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He unhooked my chain,” said Elephant.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And opened the gate to my corral,” added
Ostrich.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I saw him talking with Zebra not a minute
ago,” puzzled Dan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Zebra,” repeated Lion, “Zebra? Where is
Zebra? Why, he is gone, too!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Here was a mystery, indeed!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Scatter at once,” ordered Lion, “and leave
no nook unsearched.” And “scatter” they
did. Some went into the depths of the cages,
others looked underneath, while Giraffe and
his family inspected every square inch of the
roofs. But not a glimpse did they catch of the
runaway pair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Redouble the search,” commanded Lion,
from his station in the center of the menagerie
tent. But scarcely had he spoken when from
a distance came the patter and clatter of
hurrying hoofs.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All searchers to the front,” countermanded
Lion. “For, if I mistake not the sound, here
comes a visitor who will doubtless be willing to
lend us her aid.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Even as he concluded there dashed into
view—whom do you suppose? The Pretty
Lady and the White-White Horse? Ah! but
you are wrong. For it was none other than
Zebra, with that mischievous Monkey perched
on his back! Down the length of the tent
the two of them scurried, traveling lickety-split.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“Here! Here!” commanded Lion. “Get
back to your places this very minute!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just as soon as we’ve let the wind comb
our hair,” came the cry in reply. And the
next moment, with Zebra’s ears flopping this
way and that, and Monkey doing his best to
look entirely at ease, the truants returned to
the group.</p>

<p class='c012'>What a picture they made!</p>

<p class='c012'>Zebra wore a bridle with a brilliant red
plume, while Monkey was lost almost wholly
to view in a gorgeous pink hat and a skirt
made of blue.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, young sirs, what does this mean?”
demanded Lion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why,” whimpered Monkey, “Zebra and
I talked it over and thought it would be fun to
play circus. So we stole away to the little
tents and borrowed some costumes. Now,
don’t scold, Lion. We didn’t mean to do
anything wrong.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hum,” answered Lion, who was really
rather pleased with the thought. “Play circus,
eh? Well—go ahead; let us see what you two
can do.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“Oh,” returned Monkey, brightening up,
“but we can’t perform without a ring, and a
ringmaster and everything like that—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And, of course, we must have music,”
added Zebra. “You see we thought that
since Elephant and Seal and their folks are
such splendid musicians, perhaps they—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Delighted, I’m sure,” agreed Elephant, amid
his family’s ponderous nods of approval.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At your service, always,” chimed Seal, as
his household clapped their funny front fins in
consent.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If no objection—will make ring,” scrawled
Giraffe on the side of a cage.</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course there was none; so, digging the
top from Dan’s pocket, and using his hind
feet as a pivot, Giraffe spread his front legs
wide apart, reached far out with his neck, and
gradually swung around in a great circle While
he described an almost perfect ring on the
ground by using the spike in the top for a
marker.</p>

<div id='i_083'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_083.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>And so this strangest of all circuses began. <em>Page <a href='#Page_83'>83</a>.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Meanwhile, many willing workers rolled a
dozen or more gayly painted “tubs” to the
edge of the ring. Then came the band bringing
all manner of drums and queer-looking horns,
to say nothing of Elephant carrying his mammoth
bass viol; after which each player took a
seat on one of the tubs and began to “tune
up” for the circus.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course, we must have an announcer,”
said Lion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll be him,” cried Tiger.</p>

<p class='c012'>Needless to say, Diggeldy Dan was the
clown, while Lion—wearing an old silk hat
that Seal sometimes juggled in the real circus,
and armed with a whip that Puma had brought
from the great tent beyond—played ringmaster.</p>

<p class='c012'>And so this strangest of all circuses began.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just watch my two ears for the tempo and
time,” said Elephant, who conducted the band.
Thus, with the bow of his great fiddle held
firmly in his forefoot, and playing notes that
fairly boomed with their bigness, he set his
ears to beating: “One, two, three; one, two,
three,” while the music tripped forth in a soft,
swaying waltz. After a few bars had been
played, Tiger raised his paw for silence and
then stepped gravely to the front of the ring.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“Ladies and gentlemen,” said he, “I take
pleasure in announcing Mademoiselle Monkeyetta,
direct from the deepest depths of Jungleland,
who, with her marvelous steed, Zebraello,
will now astonish you with her wonderful
feats of riding.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At this Seal and his family played a ringing,
lingering “ta-ta-a-a-ah” on their horns; the
band struck up the liveliest of melodies, while
into the ring trotted Zebra with Monkey posed
on his back. Close behind came Diggeldy
Dan, balancing his round, pointed hat on the
tip of his nose.</p>

<p class='c012'>And then, at a whip-crack from Lion, the
riding began.</p>

<p class='c012'>Around and around went the galloping
pair—a maze of black and white stripes surmounted
by a higgeldy-piggeldy ball of ruffles
of blue, a flopping pink hat, with here and
there a brown leg or an arm. At first Monkey
did little more than hold fast to Zebra’s short
mane. But, gradually becoming used to his
steed’s measured stride, the merry-eyed fellow
dared to stand on his feet and to dance as
they flew round the ring. At this all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>animals applauded with glee, while Lion
cracked his long whip even more than before.</p>

<p class='c012'>Faster and faster went Elephant’s ears.
Faster and faster went the music, and faster
and faster sped Zebra. And then, all of a
sudden, this wonderful steed stopped short
in his tracks, sending Monkey high over his
head!</p>

<p class='c012'>All leaped to their feet to see the marvelous
rider sitting quite in a heap and striving to
free his face from the depths of his hat which
had been completely switched about by the
tumble.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I say, there! That wasn’t one of the things
we planned to do,” sputtered Monkey from
inside the bonnet.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know it,” admitted Zebra, as he did his
best to smother his laughter; “but, as I was
going round and round it occurred to me that
I would make a far better looking trick mule
than a handsome circus horse. And, as trick
mules always toss their riders over their ears—why,
I just came to a stop, and—there you are.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” assented Monkey, rather ruefully,
“here I am.” But, scrambling to his feet and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>disposing of the bonnet, he caught the twinkle
in every eye. And then he, too, burst into a
merry laugh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Zebra, you were quite right,” he said.
“Perhaps we were both taking ourselves a bit
too seriously; for, I’m bound to confess, I
hardly look like one of the beautiful circus
ladies who ride round the rings.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Anyway, it all added to the fun,” said
Diggeldy Dan. “In fact, Zebra reminded me
of a donkey I once rode in a small one-ring
circus of the long, long ago.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, then you were not always with the
very biggest kind?” questioned Puma.</p>

<p class='c012'>“By no means,” answered Dan, “and,
indeed, might never have been had I not met
Gray Ears, the Elephant.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A story, a story!” cried Leopard. “Tell us
the story!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“To-morrow I will,” agreed Diggeldy Dan,
“for the Petal Watch warns me there is no
time to-day. Come, now, Zebra, hurry away
with the plume and costume and put them
where they belong, while Monkey and I close
each door and corral.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“At twilight to-morrow,” the clown called
again, as Zebra returned and his chain was
hooked fast; “then I’ll tell you the tale of a
midsummer’s day, away back in the dim,
distant past.”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> Not in all Spangleland, nor, for that
matter, anywhere else, is there to be
found quite such a twilight as that
which is spun in the great tent that belongs
to the “monkeys, and lions, and tigers and
things.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As you must often have noted, there is
among the breezes, a certain one that is
extremely partial to animals. It is never
happier than when ruffling the forelock of
some big dapple-gray; teasing the tail of proud
chanticleer; or cradling a gull in its wide-spreading
arms. Indeed, it is the very “vagrant
breeze” of which, doubtless, you have
heard many times. But, wherever its fancy
may carry it throughout the hours of the day,
it always reaches Spangleland just before the
sun dips from view. There it seeks out a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>hiding place on the edge of the town, to watch
and to wait. And, at the first sign of eventide,
this knowing breeze slips along near the ground,
wriggles under the wall, and so comes inside
the menagerie tent.</p>

<p class='c012'>Once within, it frolics this way and that,
but so very slyly that even the keenest-eared
of the animals can no more detect it than one
might hear a butterfly sing. Yet it is here,
there, and everywhere, rubbing its nose against
the blue of the poles and its back and its sides
against the cages of red. In doing this it
takes just a bit of the color of both and so
clothes itself in a soft, purple coat. Then,
when it departs, it leaves the filmy garment
behind, and that, you see, is the twilight.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, it was just at the moment when this
vagrant breeze had cast off its robe that Dan
wound his arms around his knees, gazed
thoughtfully across the tops of them and
started the story of Gray Ears, the Elephant.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It all began with the beckoning trees,”
he said rather slowly. “You see, they kept
calling me. I was never far from them. The
one-ring circus of which I was a part was so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>very small that it never ventured into the
cities, but contented itself with visiting the
smallest of hamlets and villages. So, as we
moved from one to the other, our winding
wagon train threaded roads that led through
the woods. When we pitched our tent, it was
often at the very edge of the trees. And
always, ever and always, they beckoned me.
At times it was as if their topmost branches
were swayed by great puffs of wind. At such
moments they would bend toward me and then
toss themselves back again, as if saying in
pantomime:</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Come on, Dan, Dan, Diggeldy Dan;
come on and play!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“And, as often as they called, just that
often did I resolve to answer. But, somehow,
I seemed never able to find the time. You see,
just because it was so very small, the circus
needed the help of all of us to put it in place,
to give the performances, and then to move
on and on. And so I was busy throughout all
the day.</p>

<p class='c012'>“As the summer advanced and the woods
grew more green and the shadows more dense,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>the call came again and again. There were
times when I was tempted to let everything
go and just skip away to the deep, leafy
depths. Now this may seem odd to you—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, but it does not,” spoke up Leopard;
“I know the feeling.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I,” added Tiger.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So do we all,” said Lion, a bit wistfully.
“Indeed, if it were not for the certain most
important reason, I sometimes think we animals
might—well, there is no telling what we
might do. But, of course, there are the
children—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, yes, the children,” repeated all the
animals, very softly.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The children, to be sure,” agreed Diggeldy
Dan. “I thought of them, too. ‘It is all
very well for you to dream of running off to
the woods, Dan, Dan, Diggeldy Dan,’ I would
say to myself, ‘but what of the children that
come to the circus to see the clowns? What,
yes, what would they say if there wasn’t any
clown? Answer me that, Diggeldy Dan.’
And yet, there came a day when all my
reasoning went to the winds.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“It happened on an afternoon when our
tent was pitched between the littlest of towns
and the greatest of woods. The crowd had
come, the band had begun to play, the circus
was in full swing. I was in the ring, jesting
with the ringmaster and cutting my cleverest
capers. But my thoughts were in the depths
of the woods. For I could see the green of the
trees through the eaves of the tent and the
rugged brown trunks through the half-curtained
door. And, oh, how they called me!
Not even the mirth of the tow-headed boy
who sat in the very front row, nor the forget-me-nots
on the bonnet of the little girl just
behind him could take the tug from my heart.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now on this day, as always, there came
the moment when I made a face at the ringmaster
while he, on his part, let fly with his
whip. And, as was the fashion, I pretended
great awe of him and dashed from the ring to
escape his advance. This bit of acting I had
done whole dozens of times, always scampering
as far as the door at the rear of the tent and
then coming back to my place. But, just as I
reached the curtain on this afternoon, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>great wind-puffs began! How the hundreds
upon hundreds of branches bent forward; and
how they swept backward again! They were
beckoning me onward, beckoning as never
before!</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so, without so much as turning my
head, I bounded on through the door and ran
straight for the trees. As I reached the first
of them, there came the voice of the ringmaster
bidding me return. Soon other voices,
voices great and small and deep and shrill,
rose in one clear cry:</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Come back, Dan! Come back, Diggeldy
Dan!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“But the woods now held me fast in their
arms.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘On, on, Diggeldy Dan!’ called every leaf.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Stop, stop!’ pleaded every child and,
mingling with their voices, I could hear the
guttural bass of the ringmaster’s shout.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How I ran! Deep, deep into the depths
of the boundless woods I sped; and deep, deep
into the boundless woods came they who gave
chase. Peering back over my shoulder, I
could see all the children, and all their fathers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>and mothers and uncles and even their aunts
coming pell-mell in pursuit, all led by the
ringmaster in his shiny top hat and shiny top
boots.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘You must not run away, Dan!’ warned a
voice from within.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Come away, come away, Dan!’ sang the
leaves from the trees.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so I pressed on. Indeed, I could not
stop. The leaves underfoot seemed in league
with those overhead. They pushed against
the soles of my feet, sending me forward by
leaps and by bounds. But, fast as I ran, those
who came after proved even swifter than I.
Looking back once again, I could see the ringmaster
had redoubled his speed. On he came,
the split tails of his coat sticking straight
out behind, while, clinging tight to the ends of
them were the tow-headed boy and the little
girl with the forget-me-not bonnet!</p>

<p class='c012'>“I was glad they were gaining on me; and
yet I was sorry. I wanted them to catch me,
and yet I did not. Meanwhile, I ran like the
wind. But they came nearer and nearer.
Now the ringmaster was so close that I could
make out the tiger-eye buttons on his very red
vest.</p>

<p>“Something came from out the air, and swept me square off my toes.” <em>Page <a href='#Page_95'>95</a>.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“A hundred paces ahead showed the shadowy
outline of a densely leafed thicket. For
this cover I sped and, rounding its shoulder,
shut my pursuers from view. And then, just
as I did so, something came from out the
air, swept me square off my toes, swung me
outward and aloft and then dropped me into
the depths of the thicket!</p>

<p class='c012'>“As I scrambled to my feet I could hear the
clamoring cries and glimpse the hurrying
forms of the throng as they swept around the
corner of the coppice that covered me. There
were children of all ages and sizes, with many
curls and many hair-ribbons held out on the
lap of the wind. And there were no end of
mothers with very bright eyes and very pink
cheeks, hand in hand with no end of fathers.
And some carried umbrellas which they brandished
overhead as they ran.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But suddenly there came a halt. For a
puzzled half-minute the ringmaster stood looking
first to the left and next to the right.
Then, as if making up his mind that I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>gone toward the north, he cut the air with
his whip, thrust it forward like a captain
leading his troops on to victory, and cried:</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Into the deeper woods!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“Instantly all the fathers pointed aloft in
exactly the same manner, and away went the
throng, raising more of a cry than before.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At this I would have recalled them. But
no sooner had I opened my mouth to do so
than there came a warning ‘S-s-s-sh’ so tremendous
that it fairly blew the hat off my
head. And, looking to the left and to the
right, I saw that I was standing between two
great mud-colored posts, roofed in with a chin
and the undermost side of a monstrous mouth
overhung with a nose that came halfway to the
ground!</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Not a word out of you,’ warned the
mouth.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Swish, swish,’ from side to side went the
nose.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tighter and tighter squeezed the two
ponderous posts!</p>

<p class='c012'>“And, meanwhile, the voices of those who
had left me behind grew fainter and fainter and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>fainter, until, finally, I could hear them no
more.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Now, then,’ said the mouth, as the posts,
which were really two legs, drew apart; and
the nose, more correctly a trunk, reached back
and lifted me to a place in the light, ‘now you
may make as much noise as you please.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“And, looking up, I found myself gazing
into the good-humored face of an elephant of
marvelous size.”</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH DAN LEARNS OF PEANUTS AND THINGS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> “At first my captor merely appealed to
me as the merriest-eyed elephant I
had ever seen—and surely the largest.
But I soon discovered that he had a
way of going about matters in a most business-like
manner. Thus he immediately began
to plan for the two of us.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Now, then,’ said he, ‘we will leave this
rather public place and go to my private
apartment. So if you will just hop to the top
of my third toe—yes, the right foot will do—and
place your arm about my knee—ah! that
is the way—we will proceed.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so, I clinging tightly to the big
fellow’s leg—a great deal as children sometimes
do when they are very small and father’s
foot is to be persuaded to give them a ride—we
started on our way, the whole of me moving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>quite like a walking stick when it accompanies
its master on a leisurely stroll through the
park. On through thicket, grove and tangled
foliage we went, and then, quite of a moment,
passed between two giant trees which formed
the natural doorway leading into a half-inclosed
room of the woods. I call it a room
because it possessed the entrance just mentioned,
a floor entirely free from undergrowth,
a raggedy west window outlined with boughs,
and a wide-spreading roof fashioned by a
gigantic vine.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Two logs with branches broken off near
the trunks, a flat-topped stump of considerable
size, and a curious hanging basket affair
formed by a lacing of vine loops completed the
furnishings. On the floor was a pile of freshly
plucked leaves.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘You will really have to forgive the appearance
of things,’ apologized my host. ‘You see
I was at lunch when I heard the shouts and so
jumped right up from the table and made my
way to the thicket. Besides, I moved in only
last night. Nothing fancy, I’ll admit; but
comfortable. I was rather taken with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>rustic furniture—so in keeping with a place of
this kind, don’t you think? But do sit down!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“And, motioning me to accept one of the
logs while he took the other, the big fellow
swung one foot into the basket-like contrivance
of which I have spoken, leaned back in an
attitude of perfect contentment and rumbled
something about ‘his idea of solid comfort.’
Then, noting that my eye was upon the queer-looking
swing that supported his foot, he added:</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Ah, I see you are interested in this little
invention of mine. A combination hammock
and provider, if you please. Hammock for
the reason you already see; provider because—’</p>

<p class='c012'>“And at that he set the foot that lay in the
loops of the vine to pumping so hard that the
whole of the roof began to rock as if shaken
by some mighty wind. Scores upon scores of
leaves soon carpeted the floor. These the
ponderous fellow swept together with the tip
of his trunk without so much as leaving his
seat, and then added them to the half-eaten
pile I had noticed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘A rather clever idea, I should say,’ said
he, with some show of pride, ‘that is, if one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>doesn’t mind eating the shingles off one’s own
house. Of course, you see the point: roof,
shingles—leaves. Ha! Ha! I thought you
would.’ And with that he laughed as though
he had made quite the best joke in all the
world. But in another moment, he had dropped
into silence only to break it again to inquire
my name.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Diggeldy Dan,’ I replied. ‘And yours?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Gray Ears, the Elephant,’ he answered as
his look suddenly changed to one of great
soberness. ‘Not just Gray Ears, mind you,
nor yet merely Elephant, but “Gray Ears, the
Elephant.” In fact, it is what one might call
a whole sentence of a name. However, aside
from the fact that it does not well lend itself
to being nicknamed, I cannot say much for it.
For, in the first place—just as there are two
sides to every story so are there to every ear.
And the under side of an elephant’s ear is
ofttimes a rare pink and frequently as speckled
as the nether part of a trout. As for the
phrase, “the Elephant,” it is absolutely and
positively silly. For, to look at me, you
would not suppose me a bumblebee, nor yet a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>bobolink, now would you? Still, such is my
name and I make the most of it. But, to
change the tune of our talk, tell me: Whence
have you come and why did you run away
from the circus?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“Answering, I told him my story and ended
by adding that had he not prevented I should
have shouted most lustily and so called back
those who, doubtless, were still in pursuit of me.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘For,’ said I, ‘it was quite wrong of me to
have run away in the first place.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Yes, in a way,’ assented Gray Ears,
‘but, on the other hand, I am sure the children,
the grown-ups, and even the ringmaster will
enjoy their lark in the woods even though they
return without you. Thus no inconvenience
has come to them, you will go back to your
place in the late evening and, in the meantime,
perform a most charitable act by lending
me your merry company for a few hours. For,
to be perfectly frank, I, too, am a runaway and
a rather lonesome one.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘You don’t mean that you are’—I began
with some excitement.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘A circus elephant,’ finished Gray Ears.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>‘None other than the mightiest and most
marvelous of all pachyderms and easily the
leading feature of the mammoth menagerie of
the Very Biggest Circus.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“And he voiced these mile-long words with
so much impressiveness that had he worn a
waistcoat I am sure he would have thrust his
thumb-toes into the armholes of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here was an adventure! A meeting with
one who came from the great, great circus of
which I, who had ever been with the smallest,
had heard and dreamed of, yet never seen!</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘But, in the woods—you—I don’t understand—’
I puzzled.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘My dear fellow,’ returned Gray Ears as he
waved in the direction of the very tallest
trees, ‘do you suppose that you are the only
one who feels the call? Besides, I had been
told that a specially interesting variety of the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pistache de terre</span></i> was to be found in this part
of the woods. So I laid my plans and, While
we were at the railroad yards? last night
awaiting our turn to go into our cars, I
walked softly away along the shadowy places,
kept to the back streets of the town and so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>finally reached the open country. But as to
the earth-nut that is said to be found hereabouts,
a whole morning’s search has failed
to discover even a single vine.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘You see,’ he continued, with a great show
of-vanity, ‘I have the largest collection of the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pistache de terre</span></i> in existence.’ And spreading
his toes apart, two at a time, and burrowing
into the openings with the tip of his trunk, he
began to take something from each. And
then, what do you suppose he finally laid in a
heap on the top of the tree stump?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What?” cried all the animals in excited
chorus.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Peanuts!” answered Diggeldy Dan. “Just
ordinary, everyday, circus peanuts. And after
all those long words, too! At least, that was
What they looked like to me. And so, never
thinking, I blurted, ‘Oh, peanuts!’ (no doubt
with a look of disappointment, for I had
expected something quite wonderful) and then
added, ‘No thank you; I don’t believe I care
for any just now. But don’t let that keep you
from having some.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Having some!’ repeated my companion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>as if unable to believe his ears, large as they
were. ‘Having some!’ he fairly shouted again
in horrified tones. And then, looking at me in
the most pitying manner he added, ‘Why,
Friend Clown, do you not suppose there are
elephants who look upon the peanut as something
more than a thing to be eaten? That
there are those of us who study them?—for
what happier hobby could a circus elephant
have than that which calls for the collecting of
this most excellent nut!</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Consider this one, for instance,’ continued
Gray Ears, as he held one of the peanuts up
to the light. ‘That is the true goober. See
with what a delicate sweep it curves in at the
waist line. Here, on the other hand, is a quite
different nut—the pindar that comes from the
islands. A sailor brought it to the circus one
day. To you, and to him, it is merely a
peanut. But to the trained eye there is a
warm, yellow tint in its wrinkled face and a
certain sweep to its curves that place it far
from its various cousins. So, during my
travels, thousands upon thousands of nuts
have passed under my eyes and, from them, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>have made this collection of exactly seventeen
different ones.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so he passed from one peanut to
another, pointing out the beauties of each,”
went on Diggeldy Dan, “and was just explaining
that the word peanut was unknown to
the children of some lands, while ‘monkey-nut’
served for a name instead, when, suddenly
stopping short and gathering his brows into
three immensely deep puckers, he fixed his
attention upon something away toward the
west.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Following his gaze, I saw a bloodred
blotch that fairly flamed far off through the
trees.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Fire!’ we both cried, as if in one breath;
and then Gray Ears began to laugh at the
thought.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Fire nothing!’ said he. ‘It’s the sun
making ready for bed.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Goodness me, so it is!’ I exclaimed.
‘I had no idea it was so late. I hope you will
not think me rude, but, really I must go at
once.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Of course you must,’ the big fellow agreed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>as he led the way from the room. ‘I fear I
have delayed you too long as it is. But
never doubt, I’ll have you back at the edge of
the littlest town in but a little while more than
no time at all. Come—on to my third toe!
Hold fast—there! We’re off!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“And with his trunk rolled into position
while I clung with both arms to his leg, Gray
Ears started forward with such amazing strides
that, had I not been standing on one of his
feet, I would surely have thought that he had
suddenly been shod with seven-league boots.
Away we crashed, making straight for the
heart of the sunset. Onward we—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hey, Dan! Dan! The Petal Watch!
The Petal Watch!” cried Monkey.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Closing, sure enough,” rejoined Diggeldy
Dan and a minute later he was skipping away
down the menagerie tent, calling a good night
to his friends and assuring them he would be
back on the morrow and tell them still more
of the tale.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH DAN PARTS WITH OLD FRIENDS AND PREPARES TO CLAIM A REWARD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> “Never, I’ll warrant you, had the
greatest of woods resounded with so
strange a commotion,” continued Diggeldy
Dan, as he again took up the thread of
his story. “Never, I’ll make bold to surmise,
had so singular a carry-all with such a gayly
dressed passenger boomed through the quiet of
its sunset hour. For what could have proved
more of a surprise to those peaceful surroundings
than the approach of an elephant most as
big as a house, coming onward with strides as
wide as a wall, and a clown clinging fast to
one foot!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yet, forward we crashed and we plunged,
making straight for the littlest town. Far
ahead the tree trunks and the low-hanging
boughs showed blue-black against the russet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>and red of the sky that windowed the woods
to the west. And from this very same spot
sprang long, fan-like rays with edges of silver
and edges of gold, travelling to meet us and
bathing all that they passed in soft, yellow
light. Straight for this light the two of us
lunged—smashingly, dashingly onward—shaking
the ground and the glades as we went:
bound for the edge of the town. Now we
came to the top of a leaf-covered slope that
played floor to an open space lined on both
sides with trees. And there, at the end, was
the fast sinking sun, while smack up against
its ruby-red face stood the spire of a church in
the town.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At sight of the steeple we slackened our
pace, veered a bit to the left, and—in a half-minute
more—reached the fringe of the trees
for which I had sped when I first took flight
to the woods. Another stride and Gray Ears
had thrust his huge head through a rift in the
foliage, and we looked out over the field. And
then I made a most startling discovery.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The circus was nowhere to be seen!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thinking I might have mistaken the spot,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>I sprang from my place to the ground. But,
alas! there were the holes that had once held
the stakes, and the tracks and the scars left
by the red wagon wheels to prove what I
feared to be only too true.</p>

<p class='c012'>“As I stood there, sadly surveying the spot,
Gray Ears strode across to my side.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘They have gone,’ I said to him, sadly,
‘gone on, leaving Diggeldy Dan.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Gone, to be sure,’ he agreed, ‘but tush,
tush—what a queer tone of voice. And whoever
heard of a clown with a mouth that
turned down! So cheer up, for doubtless it is
all for the best. And in the meantime let us
again seek the trees, for I think I heard someone
approaching.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“True enough, as we slipped out of sight
three figures came toward us along a path that
skirted the field. And, there walking hand in
hand with a big, broad-shouldered man, were
the tow-headed boy and the little girl with
the forget-me-not bonnet.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Of course, they’ll get another one, won’t
they, Uncle Tommy-Tom?’ the little girl was
asking as they came within hearing.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“‘Oh, by all means. Every circus must have
its clown.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘But where-from will he come?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Well, I’m not certain,’ replied the one
called Uncle Tommy-Tom, ‘but I saw the
ringmaster getting a gayly colored suit from
out a big trunk just after we had returned
from the chase. And there was a man fussing
with an odd-looking wig and mixing some red
and white paint. Then I heard the two of
them talking, and the man with the paint said
he’d have everything in shape by the time
they reached the next town.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Oh, then, of course, they were getting
ready to make a new clown,’ spoke up the
tow-headed boy in a most knowing and positive
fashion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Make one?’ questioned the little girl.
‘Make one how?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Why, up, to be sure,’ answered the boy.
‘Clowns are always made up, though I can’t
tell you up where ’cause the piece I read
didn’t say.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so, still talking, the three of them
melted away in the gathering dusk. Even as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>I stood gazing down the path they had taken,
I felt my companion’s trunk on my shoulder.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Come, come, Friend Dan, there’s nothing
to be gained by tarrying here. Besides, I have
already put my wits back to work and hit
upon a plan by which even now you are as
good as engaged as a clown with the Very
Biggest Circus.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘No, not a word,’ was his warning command,
as I sought to ply him with questions.
‘For I have not yet completed the whole of my
scheme. Besides, our first thought must be of
a lodging place for the night. So—your arms
round my leg once again.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“Obeying, I mounted the big fellow’s foot
and we plunged back into the depths of the
woods. Presently we came to a space well
covered with grass and here we made ready
for bed. Hollowing a hole for the bumpy part
of his head, Gray Ears was soon stretched out
on his side, while I, using the curve of his
trunk for a pillow, snugly bunked in the lee of
his ponderous front knees.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Twice I sought to speak of the plan he had
named and twice did my companion bid me be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>silent. And so, lying there gazing upward
through the canopy of boughs to the patches
of star-sprinkled sky, I pictured the future
that unfolded before me.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The night was balmy and there were
sweet-smelling flowers near my head. Gray
Ears’ trunk made a most comfortable cushion,
and close by a cricket sang. So, in spite of my
musings, I was soon ready for sleep. Indeed,
I rather resented being suddenly roused and
told to make ready for another march through
the woods. Still, I obeyed, and in what seemed
even less than a twinkling, found myself in a
tent of marvelous size. In it were simply
whole battalions of clowns and, most wonderful
of all, a fireplace quite as big as the side of
our own Hippo’s cage. Then from somewhere
there dangled dozens upon dozens of mile-long
vine branches, and taking hold of the ends of
them the clowns began to bind some one fast
to the ground. Even as I looked I saw that
the ‘some one’ was Gray Ears. Yes, the
strange clowns were making the big fellow a
prisoner, and, prying his great toes apart,
were extracting the peanuts one at a time!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>As fast as the nuts were removed they were
taken to the front of the fireplace. In vain
did their owner protest. All were to be
burned on the spot.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Finally the first of the peanuts was pushed
to the edge of the fire. In a moment I recognized
it as my friend’s favorite nut—the
delicately colored pindar that had come from
the islands. And crying, ‘No! No! Not that
one!’ I bounded straight for the hearth, bent
upon rolling the nut from the flames. The
heat was intense. I could feel its hot breath
on my brow. Then a wind seemed to fan the
flames into great, leaping tongues and, looking
about, I saw that all the clowns had joined
round with hand-bellows, which they were
pumping for all they were worth. At the
same moment I reached forward to rescue the
peanut. And then—I opened my eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Above me was the same canopy of boughs,
but through one of the chinks where there
once had shone stars a great shaft from the
sun poured its warm, dazzling light full in my
eyes. Next, though not so much as a leaf was
astir, I felt the touch of a breeze and, turning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>my head, saw a vast, moving car flopping
first up and then down! And under that ear
was a face wearing a most mischievous smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Why—Why—it’s morning!’ I cried, springing
up. ‘But where is the tent! And the
clowns!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Morning, sure enough,’ answered Gray
Ears, as he ponderously rose to his feet.
‘As for tents and clowns and all that sort of
thing, I’m sure I’ve seen none, though I must
say you were making fuss enough just before
you waked up to have been playing hide-and-go-seek with all in existence. But tell me what
it all was about.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so, as we busied ourselves gathering
berries and green grass for breakfast, I related
the whole of my dream.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Now, really,’ I questioned in ending,
‘are there that many clowns with the Very
Biggest Circus?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Goodness, no,’ laughed Gray Ears. ‘Still,
there are many—two score and more.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Alas, then,’ I sighed, ‘they will not need
Diggeldy Dan.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Nevertheless they will keep you,’ answered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>my friend, as we sat down to our meal,
‘and for this reason: as you of course know, I
am a runaway from the Very Biggest Circus,
and one of its very great features. Now,
while I said nothing at the time, I came
upon this placard tacked to a tree while you
were examining the circus grounds at the edge
of the town last night.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“And with that Gray Ears produced a
square of bright yellow cardboard with these
words in tall type printed on it:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>LOST</div>
    <div>Gray Ears, The Elephant</div>
    <div>Large and Suitable</div>
    <div>Reward if Returned</div>
    <div>to</div>
    <div>The Very Biggest Circus</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“‘Goodness,’ I cried at the sight of it,
‘we must be careful else some one will capture
you and take you back home before you are
ready to go!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Careful, bosh,’ retorted Gray Ears. ‘Why
begin being careful when I am already captured?’</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“‘Already captured!’ I exclaimed in amazement.
‘By whom?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Why,’ said he, ‘by none other than
Diggeldy Dan.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘But I don’t understand,’ I began. ‘You
mean—’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘That you are to take me back to the
Very Biggest Circus and claim the reward—the
reward of being allowed to be one of its
clowns. So come now, make haste and let us
break camp. For we must be ready to enter
the big tent to-night and between now and
then we have a long way to go.’”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH DAN AND GRAY EARS ARRIVE AT THEIR GOAL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> “Some day I may relate the happenings
that fell to our lot between the heart
of the woods and the great river’s
edge,” continued Diggeldy Dan. “But I fancy
you are just now most impatient to learn exactly
what came to pass when Gray Ears and
I reached our long journey’s end. So, suppose
we all shut our eyes very tight, give a marvelous
jump and, thus leaving the point where
breakfast was had, land plump on the spot
from whence I got my first glimpse of the
tents that were to be my new home.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The day was most done when, forcing his
way through a thicket, Gray Ears emerged on
a grass-covered ridge that reclined with its
head in the woods and its feet at the brim
of a river. The stream wound to the north
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>and to the south, while just across it—and
so very near the bank that one wondered the
buildings did not tumble into the water—lay
a city. And within the city—close by the
edge that was nearest us—sprawled a great,
billowing something of dazzling white. This
something swayed gently in the sun’s lowering
rays or waved to the breeze with its pennants
and flags of yellow and blue. Yes, there it
lay, quite as if it awaited our coming—the
home of the biggest circus of all.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘And to-night, when darkness has come,
we shall both cross the river and so reach the
very rear of the tents,’ said Gray Ears, as his
eyes followed mine over the face of the stream.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Is it there we will cross?’ I asked, as I
pointed toward a massive iron bridge.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘What! And meet no end of persons and
things! Certainly not. I have a far better
way. But we must bide our time and meanwhile
gather a supply of long, trailing vines,
the purpose of which you will learn later on.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“So the last hour of the day was spent in
searching the woods for vine branches, being
careful to select only those that were well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>strung with leaves. By the time we had
completed this task and returned to the
ridge, darkness had fallen and the lights been
set twinkling in the city and tents that lay
over the stream.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Now all is ready,’ said Gray Ears. And
bidding me take the mass of vines in my
arms, he put his trunk about my waist and
lifted me—not to my place on his foot—but to
the very tip-top of his head. And as I knelt
there, with the vines between my knees and
my hands clasping fast to the upper edge of
his ears, the big fellow swung straight down
the slope and walked smack into the river!</p>

<p class='c012'>“So carefully did Gray Ears advance that
his great feet made hardly a splash. I could
hear only a soft, gurgling sound that came
from where the current, suddenly meeting the
side of what it probably mistook for a queer-fashioned
rock, protested in some little surprise
before slipping around the ends of it.
Finally even this murmuring ceased. All
movement seemed stilled. Looking about I
saw that the whole of Gray Ears—not counting
the top of his head and a part of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>trunk—had become submerged in the depths
of the stream. And so, while I perched in my
place—quite as though I were voyaging on
the back of a turtle—Gray Ears swam on.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All went as it should until we reached the
very middle of the river. Then a rowboat
suddenly shot into view from the lee of a low,
wooded island. Two men were in it—one at
the oars and the other idly dangling a lantern
from his place in the bow. It was headed
straight for us. Even as I looked, the rays of
the light fell full on my face. I quickly
crouched down, but not before the man in the
bow had caught sight of me.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘A clown! A clown! A sure-enough
clown!’ cried he to the one at the oars. ‘Pull
to just a bit. There! No, I have lost him.’
And he began to cast about with the lantern.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Meanwhile I felt the tip of Gray Ears’
trunk pressed close to the side of my head.
Grasping the end of it, I held it up to
my ear while through it came a whisper in
warning:</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Quick! Down on your knees—with one
arm thrust in the air. We must escape them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>and their questions, for we cannot afford the
delay!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“Even as I obeyed I could feel the great
trunk winding in and about me, and knew
that Gray Ears was wrapping me round with
the trailing ends of the vines!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Meanwhile the man with the lantern
was pointing it this way and that, while his
companion kept insisting that he had seen
nothing at all.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘But I did,’ he protested. ‘I saw the whole
of his round, funny face and, believe it or not,
he was sliding along on the top of the water.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“At this reply the one who was rowing
almost tumbled over with laughter. In doing
so he loosed his hold on the oars so that the
boat swung about and so almost bumped into
Gray Ears and me.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘There goes an old log with a broken-off
limb all covered with vines—how would it do
for your clown who sits on the water?’ jeered
the doubting one. And, he still poking fun
and the other still looking, the two of them
passed on, while we again took to our course,
to finally land on the coveted shore.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“We found ourselves standing in what
seemed to be a yard of considerable size and
skirted on all but the river’s side by a very
tall fence. To the right and the left were
gigantic bunkers piled high with coal. Between
these we advanced, but had gone scarcely
three paces when we came face to face with a
big, bearded watchman who carried a glaring
white light in one of his hands and a knotted,
black stick in the other.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Hey, there!’ he cried. ‘You can’t come
in here. It’s ’gainst the rules.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘But, sir, we must do so,’ I pleaded.
‘We’ve just got to go on.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Got to nuthin’,’ retorted the man. ‘There’s
orders writ plain as paint. Now you two
gwan right back into the river.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“And he turned his light on a huge board of
white on which there appeared in very black
letters:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>NOTICE</div>
    <div class='c004'>All Persons Are Warned to Keep Off These Premises</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“‘Yes,’ I cried, ‘but that can’t possibly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>mean us because we’re not persons but just
Gray Ears and Diggeldy Dan.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Not persons, eh,’ repeated the watchman
as he scratched his head, ‘Well, now, I don’t
know about that—’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Besides,’ rumbled Gray Ears, ‘you see
the—’</p>

<p class='c012'>“And he placed the nose of his trunk near
the big watchman’s ear and whispered something
I couldn’t quite hear.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Oh!’ came the reply, ‘Oh, in that case—of
course. Why in the world didn’t you say
so at first!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“While to my utter surprise, he hurried to
the gates that led to the street, unfastened the
lock and threw them apart with so much of a
flourish that one might have supposed us a
prince and his train.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Through the opening strode Gray Ears and
we were once more on our way. Long rows of
warehouses as dark and as silent as the depths
of the night now shut the Very Biggest Circus
from view. But over the edge of their frowning
black tops a warm, yellow glow lighted
the face of the sky. And we knew that this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>came from the tents for which we were
bound.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Up street and down street the two of us
went, meeting no one at all. And then, of a
sudden, our path was beset by a burly
policeman who seemed not one whit less than
a whole half-mile tall. There he stood—twirling
his moustache and his round, polished
club, and whistling a tune from over the seas.
But at sight of us he shut his lips with a
start, brought his club to his side and, raising
one hand, signaled an immediate halt.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Stop!’ he commanded. ‘You cannot come
down this street.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“But Oh!—Mr. Policeman, we just have
to,” I cried.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Sorry, but this is a one way thoroughfare.
Vehicles can’t move in the direction you are
going. You’ll have to turn back.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Yes,’ argued I, ‘but Gray Ears isn’t a
vehicle—he’s only an elephant.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Makes no difference,’ answered the policeman.
‘Orders are orders and no exceptions
made.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“And with that he began to twirl his club
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>once again and to parade back and forth as if
to guard the whole width of the street.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘But, you see, Mr. Blue-Coat,’ began
Gray Ears. And he finished the sentence in a
whisper with his trunk against the other’s
right ear.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘O—o—oh!’ exclaimed the policeman. ‘Oh—why,
go right ahead. Oh, I’m sorry to have
delayed you.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“While he actually stood at salute as we
once more moved on our way! Determining
to ask my companion very soon what it
was he had said to the watchman and to the
one in buttons and blue, I held fast to the
big fellow’s ears and, peering ahead, awaited a
glimpse of the tents. Then, turning a corner,
we came into a street and there—away at the
foot of it—lay the goal that we sought, all
flooded with lights of amber and gold.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At sight of the tents Gray Ears came to a
stop in the shelter of a well-shadowed wall and,
placing his trunk round my waist, lifted me
from his head to the ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Here, Friend Dan, we find ourselves at
our journey’s end. A minute more and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>shall have entered the great tent and you
claimed the reward of finding and returning
Gray Ears, the Elephant. It is then that you
will take your place among the clowns and I
go back to my station. We have had our
holiday together and a right merry one it has
been. Who knows—perhaps we shall one day
repeat it again. In the meantime do not be
surprised if I cease speaking to you. For,
unless I am away from the circus, I rarely
talk to anyone. Indeed you might spend
months upon months with the Very Biggest
Circus and yet never hear one of its animals
utter so much as a word.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘And now,’ he added, in that business-like
tone which he assumed at times, ‘let us decide
upon the manner in which we will enter the
greatest tent. First of all we will arrange the
placard that I found tacked to the tree and
which I believe you have in the top of your
hat. Here is a stick of charcoal which I
picked up in the coal yard as we passed
through the gates. On the side of the card
that is blank you must write in a very bold
hand:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>FOUND</div>
    <div class='c004'>By Diggeldy Dan</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Taking the marker I did as he wished.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Excellent,’ approved Gray Ears. ‘This I
will take charge of and display in proper
fashion when we make our grand entrance.
You, on your part, will stand on my back.
Now then—up you go!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“And with that I was swung into place.
Next, Gray Ears wrapped the long, leaf-covered
streamers around his neck and looped
one of them well into his mouth quite as a
horse wears a bridle and bit. Then he tossed
me the ends which I wound around my wrists
just as you have seen the driver of many
horses do with the ends of his reins. Next I
sprang upright on Gray Ears’ broad back.
There I stood, feet apart, my head held erect,
leaning backward and aslant, but kept well in
place by the vine-reins that led from my
ponderous mount’s mouth.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Are you ready, Friend Dan?’ came the
rumbling cry.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“‘Every bit of me,’ I called in reply.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then, not answering in words but with a
trumpeted note of much triumph, Gray Ears
moved forward while I, my suit flapping in
the breeze brought about by his speed, lay
back on the reins much as the driver of a
thundering chariot rests upon his, and wondered
and waited and watched.”</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH DAN JOINS THE VERY BIGGEST CIRCUS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> “Never had Gray Ears taken such stupendous
strides,” said Diggeldy Dan,
as he once more went on with his
story. “So fast did he move that in less than
a minute we had reached the edge of the light
that spread like a fan round the tents. And
then we plunged into the midst of it to find
ourselves in the very back yard of the circus.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Through the maze of red wagons the two
of us went, past little white tents that shimmered
with light, and next—in much slower
and more methodical fashion—picked our way
through the groups of playful, plumed ponies,
each decked with trappings that shone like
the stars. Past these went the both of us—past
these and strange men and strange
women, too, all dressed in gay costumes of
every color and hue. But at sight of the latter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Gray Ears warned me to drop down on his
back and hide quickly away in the long, winding
vines. And when I had done so—without
once being seen—he headed straight for the
rear of the greatest of tents, from whence
came the sound of the circus.</p>

<p class='c012'>“How it fell on the air and fell on the ear—a
mingling of music and the hum of the
crowd, blended with hoof-beats and laughter!
Now naught save a curtain divided us from the
all of it, and this Gray Ears thrust back with
a swing of his trunk. And then, in the space
of much less than a wink, what wonders came
into view!</p>

<p class='c012'>“There were people to the left of us, people
to the right of us, and still more across from
us, all terraced in masses around a tent so
tremendous that its far ends were lost in a
shadowy haze. There were pretty ladies to
the left of us, pretty ladies to the right of us,
and pretty ladies in front of us, all mounted
on horses that ran round the rings. There
was a ringmaster to the left of us, another to
the right of us, and a third just before us, each
arrayed in the latest of fashionable dress. And,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>high up above us, were splashes of red and
dashes of blue that were reflected from the
sides of the massive round poles that held the
huge tent in its place. There was the sheen of
the sawdust and the gray of the roof; the
clusters of golden lights that flooded the air
and flooded the ground, and the clusters of
silver lights over the rings at the ends that
looked in the distance like bits of the moon.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And into the midst of this hoopla and
whirl, into the heart of the Very Biggest
Circus stepped Gray Ears, with me hidden
away on his back. So quickly, indeed, had he
come through the doorway that those in the
rings and those in the crowd did not know of
his presence until he was well into the tent.
And then he was discovered from all sides at
once.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Hey, lookit! Hey, lookit!’ cried those to
the left and those to the right.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Well, of all unheard-of things!’ the pretty
ladies exclaimed as they brought their mounts
to a halt.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Now tell us at once,’ the three ringmasters
demanded, each stamping his foot as if to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>resent it, ‘what’s the meaning of this strange
interruption!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Yes, do so, right now!’ every fair rider
protested as she gave a toss of her head to
prove that she meant it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But for answer Gray Ears merely kept on
his way, down the track that circled the tent.
Still onward he went around the most distant
ring—one of those with the cluster of silvery
lights that looked like bits of the moon. And
trailing behind in most persistent fashion
came the trio of ringmasters all talking at
once and urging that Gray Ears begone to his
station.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yet never a sound did the big fellow utter
until he had reached the ring in the center.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Cling fast and be ready,’ then came his
command as the end of his trunk brushed the
vines near my ear. And kneeling and holding
the placard on high, he gravely bowed to the
crowd and bowed to the riders and bowed to
the ringmasters three.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Found!’ they all cried as they read the
words I had written, ‘Found by Diggeldy
Dan!’</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“‘But who,’ puzzled all in the very next
breath, ‘is this one called Diggeldy Dan?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘And where may he be?’ questioned the
ringmasters three, as they all cracked their
whips for attention.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Yes—</div>
      <div class='line in4'>where—</div>
      <div class='line in6'>is—</div>
      <div class='line in8'>he?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>demanded four separate voices, each of the
four of them supplying a word. While into
the ring stepped the men who had spoken,
all wearing black suits and high hats of silk
and mustaches as dark as the tips of their
boots.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘We,’ said the first.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Will,’ added the second.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Reward,’ spoke the third.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Him,’ finished the fourth.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And each drew a purse from his pocket.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At the very same moment Gray Ears put
down the card and, lifting both me and the
vines from his back laid the queer-looking
bundle at the feet of the four. No sooner had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>he done so than I thrust the branches aside,
jumped to my toes and bowed low to those at
whose feet I’d been placed.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Who—</div>
      <div class='line in3'>may—</div>
      <div class='line in4'>you—</div>
      <div class='line in5'>be?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>exclaimed the four in surprise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Why, the one who found Gray Ears,’ I
cried in reply, ‘none other than Diggeldy
Dan!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now at the sight of my face and my
polka-dot suit and the sound of my ting-a-ling
name, all the children immediately rose in
their seats and began to shout and to sing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘O, Dan, Dan, Diggeldy Dan,</div>
      <div class='line'>O, Dan, Dan, Diggeldy Dan:</div>
      <div class='line'>Do play some pranks for us, Diggeldy Dan!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“But at this the four frowned and held up
four separate hands, whereat the three ringmasters
again cracked their whips and called
for all to be silent. And then the four opened
their purses.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“‘No! No! Not a penny!’ cried I, as
I watched them, ‘for it’s not that kind of a
reward that I’d like best to request.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Ah, ha!’ said the first.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Oh, ho!’ winked the second.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘What then?’ queried the third.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Is your wish?’ asked the last.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Just to stay with you always,’ I answered
the four of them, ‘to be one of your clowns, to
cut pranks for the children, and sometimes see
Gray Ears, the Elephant.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Granted most gladly,’ each and all of
them cried, while the children added their
welcome; ‘this very night you shall take your
place with the rest, so make ready at once to
join with them.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“I answered this speech with another low
bow and then skipped to where Gray Ears
was standing. At a nod of his head I mounted
his foot and held fast to his knee while, amid
shouts of delight from the children, the big
fellow set off in very grand style toward his
home in the menagerie tent.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Gray Ears,’ I questioned, as we came
almost to it, ‘now do tell me what it was you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>said to the watchman and what it was you
whispered in the policeman’s right ear?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Why,’ began he, ‘But see what is happening!
There! On down the tent!’</p>

<p class='c012'>“What I saw as I looked was whole dozens
of clowns pouring in through the curtain we
had passed when we came. Peal after peal of
merriest laughter attended the sight of them.
But amid it and the music we could hear
voices calling:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘O, Dan, Dan, Diggeldy Dan,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where’s Dan, Dan, Diggeldy Dan?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“‘What I whispered,’ said Gray Ears, again
answering my question, ‘was simply, “The
children are waiting for us.” And, from the
sound of the shouts that are now greeting our
ears, I think I wasn’t far wrong. So go now;
go to those who are calling your name.’</p>

<p class='c012'>“As he finished he gave me a gentle shove
with his trunk and turned to go into the
menagerie tent, while I skipped gayly away to
join the rest of the clowns.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And with that,” ended Dan, “you have
heard the whole of my story.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“Did Gray Ears ever run away any more?”
asked Camel.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Time’s up! Time’s up” called Hippo,
who had on this day been placed in charge of
the Watch.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Away to your places, then,” ordered Diggeldy
Dan, “and to-morrow we’ll meet once
again. For though my tale’s at an end, we
may safely depend that another will soon
follow after.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH THE ANIMALS ENTERTAIN AN UNEXPECTED CALLER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> In Spangleland’s realm are many massive
blue poles, and among the biggest of these
are those that stand in the center of the
menagerie tent. Between the bases of two of
them is a broad, open space, and it was here
all the animals were gathered at twilight on
the day following that upon which had ended
the tale of Gray Ears, the Elephant.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I’m sure all remember your very last
words,” Lion was saying to Diggeldy Dan.
“As I recall them they ran something like
this: ‘For though my tale’s at an end we may
safely depend that another will soon follow
after.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Exactly,” said Dan. “And now comes the
question as to who’s to provide the next
story.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>But, to the clown’s great surprise, not a
single animal made answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My goodness!” he cried, as he swung
around on Hippo’s vast back the better to be
able to face them, “do you mean to say that
not one of you has thought of a story? Why,
Mr. President, I am indeed astounded! I—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Aw, now, Dan, don’t be talking like that,”
protested Monkey. “I know a lot of stories
only I just can’t remember one right now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And those I know are all so very old,”
pleaded Great White Bear, while all the rest
seemed ready to excuse themselves on much
the same score.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” said Lion, “in view of all this,
there seems to be but one thing to do and that
is to put on our thinking caps and not take
them off until each has thought of a story.
So let us get down to business at once. Tiger,
you will kindly come forward and stretch
yourself on the ground. There—that is the
way. Now, then, do you slowly wave your
tail from one side to the other. Exactly.
You, Dan, will keep count of the tail-waves
until you have recorded exactly one hundred.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>And until that number is reached there’s not
to be a word from a one of you. Instead, you
are to keep silent and think. All ready now—go!”</p>

<p class='c012'>At this word of command Tiger’s tail began
to rise and to fall and Dan’s head to nod down
and then up as he kept exact track of the
waves of it. Quite at the same time all the
others solemnly puckered their brows, half
closed their eyes, or pillowed their chins as
folks always do when they engage in deep
thought.</p>

<p class='c012'>Time passed.</p>

<p class='c012'>Tiger’s tail floated up and down through the
air.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dan’s head continued to bob and to count.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lion gazed about with so severe an eye that
hardly an animal dared breathe. Not a sound
broke the silence. And then, of a sudden—!</p>

<p class='c012'>Tap! Tap! Tap!</p>

<p class='c012'>Now the taps were not specially loud and,
aside from that fact, there is, as a rule, nothing
particularly unusual about an innocent tap,
nor, for that matter, about two nor yet three
of them.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>But, in this case, you see—everything was
so very still with even Monkey not so much as
uttering a sound, that——</p>

<p class='c012'>Tap! Tap! Tap!</p>

<p class='c012'>There it was again!</p>

<p class='c012'>And, oddest of all, it seemed to come from
a point high over their heads.</p>

<p class='c012'>Tap! Tap! Tap!</p>

<p class='c012'>And at this you may be sure the business of
thinking of stories was entirely forgotten.
Instead, every ear was alert. It now seemed
certain that the taps had come from the top
of the biggest blue pole.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ahoy, whoever you are—what is it you
want?” called Lion, as he directed his eyes and
his voice toward that point in the roof where
the pole passed through to the skies.</p>

<p class='c012'>Tap! Tap! Tap! came the answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come in!” roared Lion, “Come in at once,
whatever you are and wherever you are!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let me skip up the side of the pole and
see just what it can be,” cried Monkey.</p>

<p class='c012'>But just at that moment there came a
muffled voice from the roof—a voice that was
something between a caw and a croak.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“Menagerie tent, Spangleland?” it called
down.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, Mr. Voice, you are in Spangleland
and this is the menagerie tent,” answered
Lion. “And now if you will be so good as to
come out of hiding—”</p>

<p class='c012'>But even while Lion was speaking a movement
was seen and with it appeared two very
black feet. These were followed by the under
side of an even blacker body; with a long,
pointed beak coming after. And thus, bit by
bit, there gradually emerged the whole of a
crow of quite remarkable size.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now those who gazed upward at this strange
visitor were immediately struck by three most
unusual things. In the first place their caller’s
head was almost wholly concealed by a
messenger’s cap that was much too large for
him. Secondly, he walked down the side of
the pole when to have flown would have been
a far simpler way. And, thirdly, instead of
showing some interest in his surroundings as
he entered, he preferred to bury his nose in the
crook of what must have been a most entertaining
book. Indeed he did not once look up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>until he had set his feet on the ground. And
then it was to find himself surrounded by all
the animals.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Lion, Lion—Mister Lion,” he inquired
rather briskly as he tucked his book under one
wing and scanned the many faces.</p>

<p class='c012'>“At your service,” responded Lion as he
stepped forward.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, sir, yes, sir—Message for you, sir,”
and removing his cap with something of a
flourish, the crow took a bit of folded paper
from out the crown of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, well!” exclaimed Lion as he opened
the missive and glanced at its contents,
“though addressed in my care it’s really for
all of us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, but what is it?” cried the animals.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, a message from the Pretty Lady with
the Blue-Blue Eyes. Here is what she says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Care of Lion,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>“‘Menagerie Tent, Spangleland:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“‘I and my White-White Horse will be quite near you
at half-past twilight on the morrow. So please be at
home, for it is very likely we will pay you a visit.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘The Pretty Lady.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>“Oh, hurrah, hurrah!” shouted all the
animals in one breath while Dan clapped his
hands with much glee.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are, indeed, a most welcome messenger,”
remarked Lion, as he turned to
where the crow had been standing. But, to
his surprise, the somber chap in the cap was
no longer there. Instead, he had perched
himself on a wheel of Giraffe’s spacious home.
Yes, there he sat, once more reading his book,
and, in addition, was now slowly munching an
apple.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I say,” repeated Lion, “a most welcome
messenger.” And this time he laid so much
stress on the very last word that the crow
jumped from the wheel in the greatest of
haste.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, sir! Yes, sir!” he answered as he
vainly tried to stuff both the book and the
apple under one wing. “Calling a messenger,
were you, sir?”</p>

<p class='c012'>At which all the animals laughed so heartily
that the crow looked quite confused and
muttered something about “time to be going.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But not unless you are entirely ready to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>leave,” remonstrated Lion, “for I assure you
that you are quite welcome to remain and
finish your apple and your book, also, if you
choose. You flew all the way from Sunset
House, I presume?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, I should rather say not!” answered
the crow, as he flipped his cap to one side with
the toes of one foot. “What would be the
fun of being a messenger-bird if one had to fly
all the time?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, but how do you manage it other-wise?”
questioned Rhino.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, jump a cloud and ride it. That’s
the way I most always do. Just let my feet
hang over the end and read my book until
it’s time to hop off.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of what do you read?” asked Lion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, it’s one of those strange-people books,”
answered the crow. “I like to read about
people. They do such funny things, don’t
they? Well, I must be getting up in the air
and looking for a cloud that is going toward
the west.” And he started hopping up the
side of the very biggest pole.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Please don’t go,” coaxed Ostrich. “Stay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>a while longer and tell us about the clouds.
You have ridden a lot of them, haven’t you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I guess a million trillion of them, at
least,” said the crow in a superior sort of way.
“But then I wouldn’t know what to tell you
about them. You should ask the Pretty Lady
if you want to know about clouds. She
knows stories about most everything. Besides,
I can’t spare the time just now.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And with his beak once more buried in his
book the bird from the west moved slowly
upward toward the roof to finally disappear
at that point where the pole passed through to
the skies.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What an odd individual,” said Puma.
“I wish he had talked more. I warrant he
could tell a lot of fine stories.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And we didn’t even learn his name!”
exclaimed Emu.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We must ask the Pretty Lady about him,”
said Lion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Isn’t it fine that she’s coming to-morrow,”
cried Zebra. “Perhaps she will tell us another
story.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No doubt she will,” put in Diggeldy Dan.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“But now our twilight’s last moments have
come so we will bid one another farewell till
to-morrow. And at the sign of the Petal
Watch we will gather again to be ready to
greet our golden-haired guest when she comes
with her prancing steed from out of the
west.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH THE PRETTY LADY CARRIES A PASSENGER INTO THE WIDE WIDE WORLD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> “Come come, now!” cried Lion, as he
hurried about with all the bustle and
importance of the grand marshal of
some holiday parade, “into line with you! No,
no; not that way—in two lines. Just as we
do when we play at London Bridge. There!
That’s more like it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was on the evening following that which
had brought the message from the Pretty
Lady with the Blue-Blue Eyes and the great
menagerie tent was agog with excitement.
Under the guidance of Lion all the animals of
Spangleland were placing themselves in a
manner befitting the approach of the expected
guest. Thus the greater part of them were
arranged in two long, parallel rows; though
there were others who grouped themselves at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>the head and the foot of the line. These
included Giraffe and his family who were
stationed at the top; Monkey and his folks
who stood at the end of it; and—Diggeldy
Dan.</p>

<p class='c012'>Meantime Lion continued to give instructions, and
just as he had finished there came
the sound of a neigh through the twilight, followed
by a silvery laugh of a voice well
remembered. Next the canvas wall gave a
billowing bulge and then opened and closed
quite like the curtains in a Punch and Judy
theater. And there, standing before them,
was the White-White Horse carrying the one
for whom they all waited.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, what an attractive formation!” the
Pretty Lady exclaimed, as the sweep of her
blue eyes took in all the groupings. “Is it
some new kind of a game?”</p>

<p class='c012'>But not a single animal made answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What! No reply?” she went on in surprise.
“Can it be the kittens have gotten
your tongues? But no—there must be some
other reason: for surely there is the tip of
something quite pink peeping from between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Tiger’s sharp teeth. Yes—now all becomes
clear. How stupid of me not to have noticed
before! For look you, my White-White Horse,
these are not sure-enough animals, but just
makebelieve ones, all stuffed with straw and
sawdust and things. So come—let us go.”
And she made as if to turn back.</p>

<p class='c012'>But at this Giraffe gave a vigorous shake of
his head.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh—ho!” cried the Lady, “so you actually
can move, after all! But why do you and your
family stand at the head of the line?”</p>

<p class='c012'>In answer Giraffe took a bit of chalk in his
mouth and, using Hippo’s broad back for a
board, scrawled,
“Reception Committee.” And then stepping
forward, he made an extremely low bow.</p>

<p class='c012'>“While I am its chairman,” Lion announced.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ah, ha! Now I see!” the Lady replied;
as she advanced at a prance on the White-White
Horse. “But you?” she inquired, with
a nod to the left and a nod to the right toward
those drawn up in two rows.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We?” they all chorused. “Oh, we are
the audience. We—”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“Pretty Lady! Pretty Lady!” called Monkey
from his place at the end, “don’t be
talking just to the audience. Please ask us
what we are.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And what, indeed, may you be?” the
Lady laughed back.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, we are the grooms for the White-White
Horse,” answered the merry-eyed fellow
as he proceeded to take charge of her mount.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, escorted by Lion and Dan—with
Giraffe and his folks filing in close behind—the
Lady was led to a gayly striped tub. Once
enthroned on the top of it she again looked
about to find all the “audience” in a halfcircle
before her. At the very same moment
they gave three ringing cheers and then took
their seats, from which they gazed at their
visitor in rapt expectation.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, well; and now that is over with,
What comes next?” asked she, from her place
on the tub.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, a story, of course,” they all cried,
quite as if nothing else could possibly follow.
“See, we are waiting for you to begin.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But,” protested the Lady, “I’d much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>rather listen. I’m sure that would prove
whole heaps more fun. Indeed, I insist.
So, Lion, suppose you select the one who’s to tell
us the tale.” And she clapped her hands at
the thought of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>But, alas, Lion could but gaze at his fellows
and then back at the Lady in silent confusion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“To tell the truth, Pretty Lady,” he finally
replied, “none of us know any very good stories.
Only last evening we tried but couldn’t think—not
even of one. Of course, Dan has many
wonderful tales; but then he has been out in
the great, wide world.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, dear,” broke in Kangaroo in a most
wistful tone, “if we could only do things like
Gray Ears and Dan!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“If we only could!” exclaimed Tiger, “then
we, too, would have stories to tell.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” the Pretty Lady said, nodding her
head and speaking very thoughtfully, “yes,
that is true.” And then silence fell on the
group. A moment later, and as if to herself, she
added, “Why, why not? Yes, it could be
done. I can arrange to take them and then
bring them back.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>“What is it you are saying?” asked Lion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Just this,” answered their guest as she
leaped to her feet. “I was wondering how I
might help you all to find stories. Now of
course the most natural way is to have you
meet with adventure.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But where?” asked Zebra.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Out in the great world, to be sure. Indeed
there is no reason at all why I should not
carry one of you off with me this very evening.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, let me go! Let me go!” cried Monkey,
dancing up and down.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Be silent, sir,” Lion commanded. “Perhaps, Pretty
Lady, you will propose the one
who will be the first to accompany you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But would not the drawing of lots be a
much happier way?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Draw lots, to be sure!” they all echoed,
in answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll attend to the details,” volunteered
Diggeldy Dan. And gathering an armful of
sweet-smelling hay, he dashed out of sight
behind Giraffe’s gilded home. Soon he returned
with a bundle of straws protruding from
his tightly clasped hands. Now the tops
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>held to view were as evenly matched as the
straws in a very new broom; while the opposite
ends were completely concealed by the cuffs of
Dan’s baggy white sleeves.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here,” announced he, “are the same
number of straws as there are animals gathered
together. But no two straws are of quite the
same length. So—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The one drawing the longest of all in the
bundle will this very night go in quest of a
story,” finished the Lady with a nod of
approval.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Exactly,” agreed Dan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Splendid,” added Lion. And, as President
of Animals, he drew the first one.</p>

<p class='c012'>“As fast as you draw them, you must
file past my seat and lay all the straws on the
top of the tub,” the Pretty Lady instructed.
“Thus we will find who is possessed of the
longest.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So forward they went and, as you may well
believe, with no end of eager wonderment.
Meanwhile the Lady added zest to the fun by
telling off the lots as they reached her.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your straw is the longest,” she would call
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>as they passed—“No! No! Here’s one longer—My, what
a short one!—Why, who could have
drawn it?—Surely not Elephant!—Now Hippo
is favored and Giraffe has been bested—But
just for the moment for now I’ve another
that’s quite the longest drawn yet.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And so, the Lady comparing all the straws
laid before her, the last of the animals finally
moved down the tent and then, doubling back,
returned with all speed to their places. Every
straw being drawn, Dan joined the Lady and
the two of them consulted for a moment
together.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, his is the longest—easily the longest,”
the animals overheard the two judges agree; and
every ear did its best to catch the sound
of a name. Then, with the longest straw held
far aloft, the Pretty Lady skipped straight to
where all the bruins were grouped and touched
one on the head with the tip of her whip.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Little Black Bear!” rose the cry from all
sides. For it was he, you see, who’d been
chosen.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now for a moment Little Black Bear was
so taken back that he could do naught but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>wrinkle and unwrinkle the end of his nose.
And when he finally found his voice there was
so much commotion that no one heard what
he said.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hurry, hurry!” the Pretty Lady was
crying, “for we must be well out of Spangleland
before the Petal Watch closes. Lively, now, Monkey, and
bring me my White-White Horse. Come Sir Adventurer, and let Elephant
help you to a seat just behind me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“With the greatest of pleasure,” cried
Elephant, as he wound his great trunk around
Little Bear’s back and lifted him into his
place.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hold tight to my waist,” the Lady directed.
“All ready, now—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wait, wait!” cried Hippo, “why we are
sending Little Black Bear away without any
lunch!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Goodness, so we are!” Lion exclaimed.
“Be quick, some of you and see what can be
got together.”</p>

<p class='c012'>At this. word of command all scurried away
in every direction and soon there had been
gathered two apples, three carrots, an orange,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>some peanuts, and a taffy-on-the-stick. These
were hastily placed in an old paper bag that
Dan dug from the depths of his pocket.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now at last we are off,” the Pretty Lady
declared, as the bundle was tucked under
Black Bear’s free arm. “Farewell till the
twilight shall bring us back once again.” And
away through the half-light the three of
them sped.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A merry journey!” cried some, as they
followed the departing ones on down the tent.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Be sure to get a good story,” called
others.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will, I will!” came the answering cry, and
with a neigh from the Horse, a ringing
laugh from the Lady and a last paw-wave
from Little Black Bear, the three travelers
passed through a rift in the wall and were
swallowed by the gathering dusk.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And now,” called out Dan, “it is high
time that we, too, were fast disappearing. So
away every one of you and, until we gather
once more, there’s a treat in the thought of
what a story’s in store.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH LITTLE BLACK BEAR SPENDS A NIGHT IN THE FOREST</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> Now when the White-White Horse disappeared through the dusk with
the Pretty Lady and Little Black Bear on
his back, his feet seemed suddenly shod with
wings. Indeed, he traveled so very swiftly
that, in telling of it afterward, Little Black Bear
was never quite certain that they had not
actually skimmed through the air. But—as he
always added in conclusion—whether they did
or did not made no very great difference. The
important point was that even the wind could
not have moved faster, so that, in most no
time at all, the three of them found themselves
at the edge of a very black, and very
deep, and very great forest.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What a wonderful place!” cried Little Black
Bear. “Do let us go on into the depths of it!”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>“No,” answered the Lady, as she brought
the White-White Horse to a halt. “At least
I may not go, for I have much else to do.
But it is here that you are to alight and set
out in quest of your story.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, that will be fine,” said Little Black
Bear, as he prepared to climb to the ground.
And then, hesitating for a moment, he added,
“But how am I to get back to the menagerie
tent?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Trust me for that,” the Lady replied,
“for in due time I shall come to you again and
then the three of us will once more return to
Spangleland.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And as her wiggley-nosed passenger scrambled
down, the golden-haired one bade him a
merry farewell and was gone.</p>

<p class='c012'>For a moment Little Black Bear stood
looking after the fleeting forms and then, turning
his face toward the forest and tucking his
lunch bag more securely under one arm, he
waddled into the deepening gloom as quickly
as his rather short legs would carry him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, it must be here that the circus gets
all its poles,” he exclaimed, as he looked about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>at the tremendously tall trees. “Goodness,
the number of them! And the size! There’s
one that’s every bit as big around as Hippo;
and another that’s even larger than Elephant.”
He recalled what the crow in the messenger’s
cap had said about a million trillion clouds.
“Yes,” he said, wagging his head rather wisely,
“there must easily be that many trees.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So, talking to himself as he went, and picking
his way around the ends of gray, gnarled
logs, Little Black Bear trudged deeper and
deeper into the forest. As he advanced the
gloom changed to night, and, though the
traveler’s eyes were very bright and quite
used to the dark, he finally decided to find a
resting place until morning.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, Little Black Bear had never spent a
night in the woods but was, on the contrary,
accustomed to snuggling close in the straw on
the floor of a splendid red and gold cage.
Still, he had often heard his elders tell of the
great wide world and he knew that hollow
trees were supposed to make ideal lodging
places. So he immediately set about to find
one. He had not far to look, for very soon he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>came to a tree of unusual size and there, in
its base, was a most inviting black hole.
Going up to it, he found that the hole opened
into a round room in the trunk. The floor
of the room was packed close with leaves that
crackled under foot as their visitor stepped
over them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, I shall be most comfortable here,”
cried Little Black Bear, “I had no idea one
could find such houses as this away in the
depths of the forest.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In fact the discovery so delighted him that
he began to sing the merriest kind of a tune
and, noting that the walls of the tree caused
his voice to seem much deeper than it really
was, he sang the song all over again. Next—because
he loved to hear the leaves crinkle
and crunch—he broke into a jig and ended by
rolling over and over on the floor. But in
doing this he all but crushed the paper bag
which held his lunch and that caused him to
remember that perhaps he should dine before
going to bed. So, getting up, he went out into
the open and sat down with his back to the
tree. Here he undid the bag and rummaged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>inside with his paw. He was very much
tempted to eat the taffy-on-the-stick but
finally decided on an apple. Munching upon
this, he sat peering into the night.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here and there winged little spots of light
glowed for a moment and then were snuffed
out again. They made Little Black Bear
think of spangles. They were about that size.
He thought they might be the fireflies of which
he had heard. But, aside from the twinkle-dots,
all was gloom broken only by immense
columns that were even blacker than the
night itself. And these Little Black Bear
knew were the trunks of the great trees that
stood near his own. How big everything was.
How cool and sweet the air. How he wished
all the other animals were with him. What a
story he would have to tell!</p>

<p class='c012'>From away in the distance came a faint
“hoot, hoot, hoot.” Out of nearby trees
dropped odd little sounds as though something
were hopping about on the branches. But by
now he had disposed of his apple and so carefully
closing the paper bag, he rose to his
feet and returned to the room in the tree.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“Gracious,” he said, “why, it must be late
as anything. I was never up this long before
in all my life. What a lark I am having—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I say, hush up, whoever you may be down
below,” suddenly broke forth a voice from
somewhere outside and over his head. “First
you rouse a body with your singing, and now
you insist upon talking to yourself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, please excuse me,” answered Little
Black Bear, feeling very much ashamed. “I
really didn’t mean to disturb any one.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, it’s all right this time, only kindly
don’t do it again.” Then, after a pause, “Will you
be with us long?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well—er—that is—I really don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Family?” inquired the voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, no!” Little Black Bear hastened to
reply, “I am quite alone. But who are you,
if I may ask?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hey, there!” came an entirely new voice, this time
from very high overhead, “how long
are you two going to keep folks awake with
that chattering!”</p>

<p class='c012'>But neither Little Black Bear nor the one
to whom he had been talking answered so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>much as a word. Instead, silence now fell as
deep as the night that surrounded the tree.
Little Black Bear hardly dared move for fear
the leaves might crackle and then, after a
time—for he had already become drowsy—he
gradually forgot the strange voices that had
come from above, and slipped away into
Slumberland.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now whether it was this sound that awakened
him, Little Black Bear had no way of
knowing, but, however that may have been
the very first thing that came to him when he
again opened his eyes was the rhythm and
ring of an echoing hammer. He knew it was
a hammer, for he had sometimes seen the men
of the circus at work on the cages. Indeed, as
he lay there on the warm bed of leaves, he
could almost see the nails slowly sink into
place.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Surely, now, some one must be building a
house in the forest,” he said, as he scrambled
to his feet and went to the door of the tree.
“Yes, and it must be somewhere up the side
of that slope.”</p>

<p class='c012'>For, now that day had come, Little Black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Bear could see that the tree in which he had
spent the night stood at the foot of what
looked to be a mountain—a mountain that
was covered with trees quite as big as those
that grew at its base. So closely did these
stand and so dense were their boughs that it
was only here and there that a bit of the sun
found its way through the leaves. Because of
this, Little Black Bear was reminded of the
soft gray twilight-time that always brought
Diggeldy Dan to the menagerie tent.</p>

<p class='c012'>There were birds of many kinds in many,
many trees twittering and teetering as if
discussing their plans for the day. Their
voices caused Little Black Bear to remember
the mysterious ones of the night. But he soon
dismissed them from mind, and turning his
thoughts to peanuts and carrots, sat down with
the lunch bag between his knees and devoured
a most appetizing breakfast. Once more he was
about to eat the taffy-on-the-stick, but again
decided to wait until later. As he finished
his last peanut, the pounding of the hammer
sounded again and then, a moment later, came
the rising and falling “gr-r-r-rrr” of a saw.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“I have just got to find out what all that
is about,” decided Little Black Bear, as he
folded his lunch bag. “Who knows? It may
prove the best kind of an adventure.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And so, guided by the song of the saw, he
started up the side of the mountain. As he
advanced the trees grew less dense and this
made more light. Long, dazzling beams that
seemed to split into thousands of glistening
splinters came from the foliaged canopy that
spread far above. Great rocks began to
appear. The grass grew more green. The
hammering was very near now. And then,
reaching the edge of what proved to be a
broad clearing, Little Black Bear came in
sight of a scene that caused him to halt in
amazement.</p>

<p class='c012'>Spread out before him was a sort of niche
in the mountain with a floor as wide as the
menagerie tent, fully as smooth and almost as
long. At the back of the niche and framed by
jaggedy rocks were two wooden doors made of
small trunks of trees bound tightly together
with bolts and with bars. Both these doors
were closed as if shutting the mouth of a cave.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>But it was what occupied the center of
the clearing that held the fascinated attention
of Little Black Bear. Here was a wide-spreading
tree and under its shade an enormously
long work-bench surrounded by whole
drifts of curlycue shavings. The bench was
fitted with a vise with wide wooden jaws,
while its face was covered with many strange
tools. Just in front of the bench and half
in the sunlight were two massive sawhorses
that supported an oddly shaped frame. And, bending
over these, a cap on his head and a
carpenter’s apron tied round his waist was a
shaggy coated bruin of marvelous size.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, of course, Little Black Bear took in
the entire scene in a whole lot less time than
it has taken to tell of it. Indeed, by now he
had softly lifted himself to the top of a rock
that he might obtain a still better view.
Then, just as he had done so, and without
the least sign of warning, the rock rolled
away with a crash, and the next moment he
lay sprawling in the clearing not a half-dozen
steps from the bear in the cap and the apron!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH LITTLE BLACK BEAR MEETS SHAGG, THE CARPENTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> Now, usually the very first thing one
does after taking a tumble is to
scramble up again. And that is exactly
what Little Black Bear was of a mind to
do when the rock on which he was standing
turned over and he suddenly found himself
sprawling almost at the feet of the great bear
who was at work in the clearing. But he
did not recover himself before the one with
the hammer had taken full account of his
plight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tacks, jackplanes and drawshaves, and
what is all this!” roared that ponderous
party, as he put his arms akimbo and gazed in
astonishment at the mass of curly black hair
that lay there before him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why—why, it’s just me come to call,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>sputtered Little Black Bear, as he winked and
blinked from his place on the ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That’s quite plain to see,” the other agreed,
in a voice that resembled nothing so much as
thunder. “But gluepots and gimlets, what is
the notion of prostrating yourself in this
humble fashion. For I assure you that I am
neither a prince nor a king but merely a hard-working
carpenter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, that—,” Little Bear repeated as he
finally got to his feet, “Oh, that wasn’t my
notion, sir; it was just the rock’s. You see it
kind of rolled out from under me.” And he
explained the happening in so droll a manner
that the big bear laughed so loud and so long
that the forest fairly echoed in answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“There, there, forgive me,” he finally said, as
he wiped the tears from his eyes with the
top of his cap, “but you surely cut a most
comical figure. And now, though it may be
none of my affair, let me ask just what it is
that has brought you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus encouraged, Little Black Bear told his
story as to just who he was, whence he had
come, and what it was that he sought.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“Well, well, now that is indeed interesting,”
the other exclaimed. “My name’s Shagg—Shagg,
the Carpenter—and I’ll be glad to help
in any way I can.” With that he extended
a paw, the two shook hands and then, at
Shagg’s suggestion, they sat down at the foot
of the tree that stood near the bench.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So you are a circus bear. My, what a lot
of wonderful places you must get to see. I’ve
often thought it would be splendid to leave the
forest and travel into the world. But then
there is Mrs. Shagg. And there are the things
to be built.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, I should think this would be the
jolliest kind of a place,” rejoined Little Black
Bear. “I can’t imagine anything quite as
interesting as building things. Have you always
been a carpenter?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ever since I was old enough to handle a saw and a
hammer,” answered Shagg. “You
see carpentering, and especially chair-making,
has been the family trade for quite a long
time; in fact, ever since the days of the Three
Bears.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The three bears,” said the other. “The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>three bears—why, you surely don’t mean the
very Three Bears!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“To be sure,” answered Shagg. “What is
so unusual about that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But there’s been books and stories and
everything written about them!” cried Little
Black Bear in rapt admiration, “about them
and Goldilocks, you know.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Goldilocks—hum—Goldilocks,” mused
Shagg. “What a piece of good fortune came
to our family when she broke those beds and
chairs. For—so the family tradition goes—it
was in mending them that Great Big Bear
found he had a knack for handling tools. That
very same summer he built an entirely new set
of chairs. Then he got to making things
for the neighbors and now—why, just look
here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And going to the doors that were made
from small trees, Shagg swung them apart and
so disclosed a deep cavern that extended far
into the side of the mountain. There, inside, were
whole dozens of beds with inviting looking
rocks for mattresses, many massive chairs
and no end of footstools to match.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“My, what a lot of them!” marveled Little
Black Bear. “Do you sell many?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, not at this time of year,” explained
Shagg, as he closed and bolted the doors.
“Most of the bear families are too busy
vacationing and roaming about through the
forest during the summer to have much use
for furniture. But as autumn wanes and they
begin to think of the long winter nights when
they will sit at home sucking their paws and
drowsing before the fire, I’ll tell you the
thought of possessing a big roomy chair and
a footstool is a highly pleasing one. And,
though I do say it, no one makes better
furniture than Shagg, the Carpenter. Why,
with anything like care, and provided the
owner isn’t a terribly loud snorer, one of my
chairs will last all of two winters. But, of
course, there are snorers that will loosen the
joints of the best chair that ever was made.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And so he rambled on, telling no end of
interesting things until, chancing to glance up
at the sun, he sprang to his feet.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Screws and screw drivers!” he exclaimed.
“I had no idea it was so late.” And he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>hurried back to the bench. “You see I
always aim to build at least one chair every
morning. Would you care to watch me work?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I’d love to,” answered Little Black
Bear.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ever use a saw?” the big fellow asked as
he busied himself at the vise.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Goodness, no. I shouldn’t know how to
begin,” answered the watcher, as he climbed
to a seat on the far end of the bench.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, just remember this, then,” instructed
Shagg, as he gave the vise-handle an extra
hard twist, “if you ever do use one—or any
tool for that matter—don’t hold it too tightly.
That’s nearly always the trouble with beginners.
They just grip for all they’re worth and
try to do all of the aiming. But what I say
is—let a saw alone. Give it something like a
free head and it will follow the line most
every time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, it’s the same way with guiding a
bicycle,” chimed Little Black Bear. “I know
when I first began to ride in the circus I used
to grip the handle bars like everything,
but—”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>And so—having become fast friends—Shagg
and Little Black Bear visited on through the
hours, their voices mingling with the song of
the saw, the ring of the hammer, and all the
happy sounds that came to the clearing from
the depths of the forest below.</p>

<p class='c012'>Little by little the morning advanced. Little
by little the shadows crept nearer the rocks
and the trees. Little by little the thing on the
sawhorses became more like a chair. And
then, just as the last touch was added, the
soft hum of noontide was broken by a voice
that came from neither here nor there nor, for
that matter, from any particular direction at
all.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Shagg—ee! Shagg—ee!” it called in an
odd, muffled note that seemed very near and
yet far away.</p>

<p class='c012'>“All right, mother! Coming, mother!”
roared Shagg as if in reply.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hurry, then, before the dinner gets cold,”
again called the voice, and this time Little
Black Bear realized that it came right up from
the ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed, we will,” declared the big fellow as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>he put down his hammer and untied his apron.
“Come, now—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, thank you very much,” protested
Little Black Bear, “but really, I have my
lunch right here in my paper bag.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nonsense!” insisted Shagg, “why mother
wouldn’t hear to me leaving you up here.
So come along with you.” And leading the
way to the far edge of the clearing, Shagg
uncovered an iron ring, raised a heavy trap
door, and the two descended a well-worn
flight of winding stone steps until they came
to a great, rugged room that was almost as
broad as the clearing above.</p>

<p class='c012'>It required but a glance for Little Black
Bear to see that the place in which he so
suddenly found himself was a cave. There
to the right was what had once been its
entrance but which had at some time or
other been turned into a window—a window
that was framed with trailing wild roses and
through which he could see the trees of the
forest and the bright green of the grass underneath.
On that side of the cave that was
across from the stairway rose a huge fireplace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>and in front of it—her back turned
toward them, and slowly stirring the contents
of a very fat and very round pot that hung
over the flames—bent Mrs. Shagg.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Mother, this is Little Black Bear; I have
brought him down to dine with us,” said
Shagg.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, isn’t that fine, now,” cried she,
coming forward. “Indeed, young sir, you
are most welcome. You will find the spring
over in the corner, should you care to wash.
It won’t take me a minute to put on an extra
bowl and then we’ll sit right down.”</p>

<p class='c012'>As she hustled about, laying another place
at the big wooden table that stood in the
middle of the cave, Little Black Bear thought
he had never met any one with such a white
cap and apron. He just positively knew there
never were any starched quite as stiff and as
straight nor adorned with such beautiful
bows. Indeed, he had hard work in trying to
tell whether the merry crackling sound that
now and then filled the room came from the
apron or the fire on the hearth.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hurry along with the both of you, now,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>called she, as Shagg and Little Black Bear
returned from the spring. And soon they
were all three at table. Little Black Bear
had never before seen such lovely dishes—beautiful
iron ones and so delightfully black.
Of course there was porridge—three bountiful
bowls of it—and a deep dish fairly overflowing
with honey. As they ate they talked,
the guest telling many stories of the circus
and a great deal about Diggeldy Dan, the
Pretty Lady, and of Spangleland.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, goodness, do eat your dinner,”
Mrs. Shagg kept saying. “Shagg, do help
Little Black Bear to some more of the porridge.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dinner over with, Shagg and Little Black
Bear drew their chairs back from the table so
that Mrs. Shagg might clear the dishes, and
this gave the visitor more of an opportunity
of looking about. Along the sides of the cave
were a number of chairs, all with very high
backs, and, between these, no less than a
dozen quaint chests with corners of brass and
handles of iron. On the walls of the cave
were many big frames fashioned from bark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>and each displaying subjects of a most interesting
kind. One pictured a wide-waisted
hogshead labeled “Molasses”; while another
showed a huge honeybee drawn many times
larger than bees really are and bearing the
title, “The Bears’ Very Best Friend.” In
fact, Little Black Bear thought all of the
paintings in excellent taste and quite in the
style that one might expect to find in the
dining room of almost any bruin.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the back of the cave was a stout wooden
door which somehow or other wore a mysterious
look. Eyeing it closely, Little Black
Bear was just going to ask as to where the
door led, when, glancing at Shagg, he saw that
the big fellow had gone sound asleep. Next
he discovered that Mrs. Shagg had done
exactly the same thing in a comfortable
rocker that stood near the fire.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, well,” said Little Black Bear to
himself, “if that’s to be the way of it, I, too,
shall indulge in a nap.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So, twisting about until he had got himself
into a quite snoozy position, he was just on
the point of closing his eyes, when there,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>among the wild roses, appeared a pink-frocked
little girl with long yellow curls.
Even as he watched, she placed her two hands
on the window, and then, softly raising it,
stepped into the cave.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH LITTLE BLACK BEAR ADDS STILL MORE TO HIS STORY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> If Little Black Bear had never before held
his breath, he most positively did when,
as he gazed with fascination at the wee
girl with the tumbling curls, he saw her raise
the window and place her two slippered feet
on the flagged floor of the cave.</p>

<p class='c012'>The first thing he noticed was that she
carried a bonnet by its long ribbons quite as
one holds the handle to a basket. This she
first placed on the floor and then, carefully
closing the window behind her, again picked
it up and started on tiptoe toward Mrs.
Shagg.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, as you no doubt remember, Little
Black Bear had got himself into a snoozy
position just as the strange face appeared at
the window, and he still lay huddled deep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>down in the depths of his chair. So, as the
one with the bonnet softly crossed the great
cave, the back of the chair gradually shut her
from view. But Little Black Bear had by this
time recovered his breath and, becoming more
bold, put his head out from under one arm of
the chair in order to see what was about to
take place. There sat Mrs. Shagg—sound
asleep in the rocker with her apron spread over
her knees. Quietly the little girl approached
her. Not a sound did she make. Except for
the steady “tick-tock, tick-tock” of the clock
that stood on the mantel shelf, there was no
sound of any kind throughout the whole cave.
Now the yellow-haired stranger was at Mrs.
Shagg’s very side, and had placed one of her
hands under the crown of the bonnet. What
in the world was she going to do!</p>

<p class='c012'>Leaning still farther out, Little Black Bear
craned his neck to see just what was about to
come next. Ah! now he saw! Their visitor
was pouring something into Mrs. Shagg’s lap.
But what was it she brought? Again he edged
himself still farther along. And then—</p>

<p class='c012'>Bang!</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Both the chair and the curious one struck
the floor with a crash!</p>

<p class='c012'>At the sound of the fall, Mrs. Shagg sprang
to her feet with the towering Shagg following
after; while at the very same moment the
floor of the cave was simply strewn with
berries that the little girl had poured from
her bonnet into Mrs. Shagg’s lap.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Plumb-bobs and sawdust, now! What’s
all this rumpus?” stormed the carpenter,
glaring about. “Oh, it’s you, is it, Tumble
Curls; did you come down the chimney and
knock over the porridge pot?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And just look at the berries—all over the
place!” cried Mrs. Shagg.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And here’s something else on the floor,”
added her husband, as his eyes fell upon a
certain sheepish-faced party who was just
then picking himself up from under the
overturned chair.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” admitted Little Black Bear, “it was
all my fault. For it was I who did it—I and
the chair.” And he recited just what had
happened. “But I’ll clean up every last one
of the berries—honest I will.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>“Pshaw, now, you’ll do nothing of the
kind, for the broom will clear them away
in three Whisks and a whee,” laughed Mrs.
Shagg.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course,” agreed Tumble Curls “while
I can easily get a brimming bonnet-ful
more.” And she started away toward the
window.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nonsense,” protested Shagg, “you’ll do
nothing of the sort; for we can go without
dessert for once, I guess. Stay right where
you are and meet our new friend, Little Black
Bear.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Pleased to,” said Tumble Curls, dropping
a curtsy and putting one hand to her dimpled
chin. And when, a moment later, she learned
that Little Black Bear was from the circus
you may be sure she forgot all about the
berries that had by now been brushed into a
dustpan by Mrs. Shagg.</p>

<p class='c012'>Indeed nothing would do but that Little
Black Bear should do some tricks for them.</p>

<div id='i_185'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_185.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Little Black Bear gladly did his tricks over and over again.&nbsp;<em>Page <a href='#Page_185'>185</a>.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“Oh, please, please do,” begged Tumble
Curls, “for I’ve never, never been to a circus,
though my grannylocks has told me about
them and, once, I saw a wonderful picture.
It showed some bears walking on big, colored
globes. Do they really do that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, of course,” answered Little Black
Bear. “That’s easy as pie. If I only had—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have the very thing,” interrupted Mrs.
Shagg, as she went to one of the chests that
stood near the wall.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course!” exclaimed Shagg. “The ball
I made you to use when darning my clothes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Out it came and soon, to the amazement of
both the big bruins and the great joy of Tumble
Curls, Little Black Bear had mounted to
the top of it and traveled the full length of the
cave. Then, as if to cap the climax, he turned
himself topsy-turvy, tossed his heels in the air,
and—of all unheard-of things—walked back
again on his paws!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, saws and sawhorses—I’d never have
believed it!” marveled Shagg.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nor I, either!” admired Mrs. Shagg. As
for Tumble Curls, she danced and clapped her
hands with so much delight that Little Black
Bear gladly did his tricks over and over again.
Finally he turned a dozen somersaults all in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>row, to say nothing of leapfrogging high above
four stools that stood near the window.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, had Mr. and Mrs. Shagg and Tumble
Curls had their way about it, Little Black
Bear would have spent the entire afternoon
performing for them. But just as he had
sprung over the last of the stools, the clock on
the mantel suddenly seemed to forget to tick
and to tock. Instead it gave forth a warning
“burr—r-r-r”, next it uttered a queer “click”
and then called out the hour in so positive a
tone that Little Black Bear turned about with
a start.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What! That o’clock!” cried he. “Oh,
then I must be going at once, else I’ll never
reach the menagerie tent by half-past twilight.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Of course the others protested, but when
they understood that their visitor really had to
leave them, they immediately offered to accompany
him at least part way through the
forest.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It won’t take me a minute to get ready,”
assured Mrs. Shagg, as she went to the door at
the back of the cave. And soon she came
forth with a beautiful cashmere shawl, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>lovely green parasol, and a bonnet simply
covered with shining jet beads. While she was
tying the bonnet strings under her chin,
Shagg had opened two of the chests. From one
he took a glossy silk hat that was almost as
tall as the mantelpiece clock; and from the
other a cane with a gorgeous gold knob.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Family heirlooms,” said he, as he handed
the walking stick to Little Black Bear for the
latter’s inspection. “Yes, sir; wonderful cane
it is, too. The very one that belonged to Great
Big Bear. Just look at the initials engraved
on the top of it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Sure enough, there were the three letters,
“G. B. B.”—a bit worn, yet still quite distinct.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And the hat?” asked Little Black Bear,
as they climbed the stone steps and came to
the clearing, “is it—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is, indeed,” answered Shagg.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My grannylocks always liked to tell of the
time when she took it and brought it back
filled with berries,” put in Tumble Curls,
“Goodness, how Great Big Bear did scold!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But he ate the berries just the same,”
added Mrs. Shagg.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>“Then your grannylocks once lived here in
the forest like you?” asked Little Black Bear
of Tumble Curls, as the four descended the
slope.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course she did. Surely you must have
heard of my grannylocks—Goldilocks, some
called her.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Goldilocks!” repeated Little Black Bear.
“Goldilocks! Well, I should say I have!
But,” he added in a puzzled sort of way,
“I always supposed that she and the Three
Bears weren’t—weren’t—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Weren’t on very good terms?” finished
Shagg. “Yes, we all know that story. But,
as I said this morning, the fact that Goldilocks
broke those chairs proved the very best thing
that could have happened to our family. So
you may be sure it wasn’t long until she and
the Three Bears became the closest of friends.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus they talked as they walked into the
deeper depths of the forest. What an odd
group they made! First came Little Black
Bear, his eyes and his ears wide with attention
and his lunch bag still tucked tightly under one
arm. At his side skipped Tumble Curls,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>swinging her bonnet and chattering and laughing
or telling no end of wonderful things about
her own home that lay in a glade high up the
mountain slope. A dozen paces behind them
came the two Shaggs, arm linked in arm—he
with his cane and very grand hat and she with
her parasol and still grander shawl. On they
went until they had got well past the great
tree in which Little Black Bear had slept
through the night; past this and almost within
sight of the fringe of the forest. And then
Shagg cried to them to halt.</p>

<p class='c012'>“For it is here that we must leave you,”
he explained. “You see, we bears of the
forest seldom or never go beyond or even to
the edge of it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It has been fine of you to come all this
way,” Little Black Bear said gratefully, “and
I can’t begin to thank you for the wonderful
time I’ve had.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“La! La!” returned Mrs. Shagg, “all we
hope is that you will visit us again some day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You’ll always find a welcome,” rumbled
Shagg, as he gave Little Black Bear a hearty
thump on one shoulder.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>“Oh, do come back,” said Tumble Curls
wistfully. “Promise you will.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll try,” answered Little Black Bear, as he
set his face toward the forest’s edge. And
then, amid the cries of farewell, he parted
from his three friends.</p>

<p class='c012'>He had gone but a short way when he felt
something rather sharp and rather hard pressing
against the crook of his arm. It came
from the inside of the lunch bag. Then he
remembered. It was the taffy-on-the-stick.
Quickly he turned back. Mr. and Mrs. Shagg
were just disappearing behind the trunk of a
tree. But not so with Tumble Curls; she was
still watching after him. Little Black Bear
now retraced his steps, fumbling in the paper
bag as he went.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here,” he said, as he reached Tumble
Curls’ side. “Here: maybe you’d like to have
it.” And he thrust the taffy-on-the-stick into
her hands and then ran away as fast as ever
he could. He recalled how he had twice been
tempted to eat the sweetmeat but had not;
and he was glad.</p>

<p class='c012'>Soon he reached the point where meadows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>came to meet the forest; and there, quietly
cropping the grass, stood the White-White
Horse.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did you find your story?” asked a voice,
while, as if to accompany the words, the
Pretty Lady with the Blue-Blue Eyes danced,
smilingly, toward him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Pretty Lady, it was a wonderful
story,” cried Little Black Bear. “You see—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not yet,” answered she, “It’s not to be
told until we get back to the menagerie tent.
So make haste to scramble to the top of
yonder treestump, while I bring the White-White
Horse to the side of it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>A moment later, Little Black Bear had
climbed to his place and, just as half-past
twilight was about to begin, the three travelers
set off with all speed to rejoin those whom
they knew were awaiting them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH DAN MEETS BEADER, OF THE JUMPING DRAGOONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> Just at the moment when the White-White
Horse left the forest’s edge to
carry the Pretty Lady and Little Black
Bear back to Spangleland, Diggeldy Dan
might have been seen flitting in and out between
the big and little tents on his way to
the one which contained “the monkeys, and
lions, and tigers and things.” Indeed, the
funny old clown in the polka-dot suit skipped
along even faster than usual; for he knew that
this was the evening that was to bring forth
a wonderful story.</p>

<p class='c012'>As for the animals, they knew this, too.
And so, no sooner had Dan’s face appeared
through the rift in the wall at the far end of
the tent than there arose a cry that threatened
to waken all the people of the circus—soundly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>though they slept. But they slept on, while,
as Mrs. Shagg would have put it, Dan and
Monkey released the impatient ones in “three
whisks and a whee.” To the center they
trooped, coming from this cage and that, or
out the corrals—leaping and laughing with
glee. And just as Lion had brought them to
order, in galloped the White-White Horse,
bearing his two precious passengers.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Home again!” cried the welcoming crew.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Home again!” echoed Little Black Bear;
while all rose to their feet to pay homage to
the one with the dancing blue eyes. Dan
assisted her to alight while Elephant’s trunk
lifted Little Black Bear to a place on the
ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now, then,” said Lion, “I know I speak
the wish of every one of you when I say that
all are most eager to hear of Little Bear’s
adventure in the great, wide world. So if you,
Pretty Lady, will accept a seat to my right
and Little Black Bear take one at my left,
I’m sure we’ll prove a most attentive audience.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’m most agreeable,” the Lady replied.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I’m just bursting to talk,” declared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Little Black Bear, “only I simply can’t sit
down to do it; I just have to stand up.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Suit yourself as to that,” laughed Lion,
“only do begin and don’t leave one thing
untold.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So Little Black Bear, with no end of gestures
and no end of wigglings of his wiggley nose,
told the entire wondrous story from beginning
to end. Then, when he had finished, there
came whole dozens of questions, all of which
he answered as best he knew how.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That was an adventure,” Lion said, finally.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Such an adventure!” the others exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let’s draw straws again!” cried Monkey,
“to see who’ll be the next to go after a story.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But perhaps the Pretty Lady—” Lion
began.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I shall be very glad to carry another
passenger away with me,” answered she, “only
I think it would be more fun if we this time
made the selection by counting out.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Counting out?” questioned Lion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“To be sure,” she replied. “First you must
all form in a circle. You, Little Black Bear,
will stand here with me, for of course you’ve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>already had your adventure. Now,” she
continued, when the great ring had been made,
“we will begin.” And she started around the
circle, repeating the words which you shall
hear while touching an animal with the tip of
her whip with each word that spoke:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Diggeldy, Diggeldy, Diggeldy Dan,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stay in the circle, those who can;</div>
      <div class='line'>Whip touch nose, or trunk or snout—</div>
      <div class='line'>The last one touched is counted OUT.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Of course that first time was just for
practice. But now we will start in earnest, and
the one who is touched by the whip when I
speak the word ‘out’ must at once step aside.
Thus we will continue until but one remains
and that one will be the next to go galloping
away on the White-White Horse.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So the counting began. Out went Zebra and
out went Seal and so on from one to another
until at last there remained only Tiger and
Dan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And now, that I may have no way of
knowing which of you I shall touch when I
speak the first word of the rhyme, I will ask
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Lion to place his paws tightly over my eyes,”
the Pretty Lady requested.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now,” warned she, when her eyes had been
covered, “are they ready, Lion?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Down dipped the whip, and the Lady began
touching first one and then the other, while
all those who were out joined in the lines of
the rhyme. And then, when it had brought
them to the very last word, all fairly shouted
a tremendous “OUT!”</p>

<p class='c012'>At the same moment Lion dropped his paws
from the Pretty Lady’s eyes and there was
the tip of her whip resting on Tiger’s left ear!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dan!” cried she, while all the animals
began chanting:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, Dan, Dan, Diggeldy Dan,</div>
      <div class='line'>Go find us a story as fast as you can!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed he will,” promised the Pretty
Lady, “for I know exactly where to take him.
Only he may have to be absent over one
twilight.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We’ll not mind,” said Lion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, not one bit,” cried the rest.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“Especially if he brings back an extra fine
story,” added Camel.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let us start at once, then,” the Pretty Lady
commanded, “for we have a long way to go.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Off dashed the animals and were soon back
in their homes. Dan locked the last door and
then, twirling about on one foot and waving a
farewell in every direction, he danced down the
tent and jumped to the back of the White-White
Horse. The Pretty Lady had already
sprung to her seat. Dan once beside her, she
touched the snow-white steed and the journey
into twilight-land was begun.</p>

<p class='c012'>Onward and still onward they galloped.
Soon darkness had come but the White-White
Horse gave no sign of a halt. Now he went
skimming up the side of a hill and then down
the face of another. But at last, as the
travelers reached the brow of an unusually
steep slope, they came in sight of the big,
yellow moon just as it was on the point of
rousing itself from the top of a more distant
hill. And it was here the White-White Horse
stopped so suddenly that Dan was all but
tossed from his seat.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Catching his balance, the clown gazed over
the Pretty Lady’s shoulder. Before and
beneath them, and to the right and the left of
them, stretched a bit of a valley that seemed
fast asleep. Some of its sides were covered
with corn fields while others were checkered
with patches of wheat. These crept downward
to the very edge of a dark clump of
raggedy trees that grew on the floor of the
valley. In the midst of the trees—but standing
much higher than the tallest of them—was
a queerly shaped tower. Now it seemed to
be thrusting its head into the moon’s great,
round face. It resembled nothing so much
as a huge grandfather’s clock. But what
could a clock be doing in such a strange
place?</p>

<p class='c012'>Even as Dan pondered, the Pretty Lady
motioned him to alight.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You are to go into the valley,” she whispered,
her face placed close to his very white
ear. “Two things you are to remember: Be
ever so careful as to just where you step;
and, if you are asked why you have come,
always answer ‘Dickory Dock.’”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Dan would have liked more instructions but,
just as he opened his lips to question the
Lady, the White-White Horse whirled about
in his tracks and was gone in the direction
whence they had come.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, well,” said Dan to himself, “I guess
there is but one thing to do and that is to go
into the valley and see what I’ll find there.”
So he started off down the slope. Soon he
entered a corn patch. As he neared the
middle of it he was joined by a breeze that
rustled the long leaves until they fairly sang at
its touch. It was a soft, murmuring tune,
with a gay little quirk, and so filled with happiness
that Dan soon found himself singing a
song of his own. How long he might have sung
there is no way of knowing, for he was still in
the midst of the melody, when he felt a sharp
tugging at the great ruffled collar that circled
his neck. Thinking the collar had caught upon
something, he turned to see what it was. And
there holding to a cornstalk while he jerked at
the edge of the ruff, was a most indignant mouse!</p>

<p class='c012'>“So! I’ve finally brought you to a halt,”
squeaked the stranger. “Didn’t you hear me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>shouting at you when you entered the corn
field? You clumsy fellow—you almost stepped
on my sentry box!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dan thought he had never before seen quite
such a mouse. Not that his face was unlike
that of other mice, but because of the dress
that he wore. This consisted of a jaunty cap
with a plume in it, a red coat adorned with
two rows of tiny brass buttons, and trousers
that were braided with gold stripes down the
sides. Around his waist ran a belt and from
this hung a sword.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now who are you and what do you want,”
demanded the mouse.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why, I’m Diggeldy Dan, and I—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That means nothing to me,” interrupted
the other, “so I shall have to ask you to leave
here at once.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But—” protested the clown.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But, nothing,” returned the mouse. “Begone,
I say, or I shall summon the guard
without more ado.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then Dan suddenly remembered what the
Pretty Lady had told him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh!” he hastened to say, “I almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>forgot.” And bending over, he whispered,
“Dickory Dock.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, now, that’s different,” cried the
mouse in the friendliest tone, imaginable.
“But why in the world didn’t you say that in
the first place?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll confess I just didn’t think,” answered
Dan. “The Pretty Lady told me to repeat
the words to whomever I met; but you see—well,
I guess I hardly expected to—to—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“To be challenged by a mere little mouse,”
supplied the guard, as he sent forth a tiny but
none the less merry laugh.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And I was also told to watch where I
stepped,” added Dan. “I hope I didn’t harm
the sentry box of which you spoke.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not a speck. But tell me what you are
and what we may have the honor of doing
for you?”</p>

<p class='c012'>So Dan did.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hum,” mused the mouse, “I’m sure I
don’t know whether we can supply any sort
of a story, but I assure you we will be most
happy to serve you and the animals of Spangleland
in any way possible. As for myself, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>will be delighted to escort you, for I think I
hear the relief guard coming this way now.
Hi! down there,” he called, as if speaking to
some one at the foot of the cornstalks, “that
you, Skipper? All right—thought I knew
your step. A quiet watch to you. I’m off
to accompany a friend down the valley.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Then, turning to Dan, he added, “You
walk right along and I’ll just hop from stalk
to stalk until we get out of the corn patch.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I’ll go slowly,” Dan assured him.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, as to that, you may run if you wish.
You see we of the Jumping Dragoons pride
ourselves on our ability to go long distances in
a very little time.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Nevertheless they proceeded leisurely, chatting
as they descended. Beader—for such
proved to be the name of Dan’s escort—explained
many things as they went and was
just on the point of answering Dan’s question
about the thing that looked so much like a
grandfather’s clock when they reached the
floor of the valley.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here,” said the mouse, “we enter the
town proper. And,” he added, making a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>low bow, “Beader takes pride in being the
first to welcome you to the Valley of Tick
Tock.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What an odd name!” exclaimed Dan.
“Why do you call it that?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Listen a moment and you will hear,”
replied Beader.</p>

<p class='c012'>So Dan hearkened. And out of the silence
there came a slow and very measured and
very musical sound. It was as if an ocean
were not far away or a brook had come to
make its home near the trees. But, unlike
the boom of the surf or the song of a stream,
this strange voice sang a much different tune.
Indeed, as Dan listened, he could plainly hear
it say—“Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now,” Beader broke in, “if you will be
careful as to where you step and follow me
closely, we will soon be in the main part of
the town.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus, he of the Jumping Dragoons leaping
in advance—his red coat a bright splotch in
the moonlight—Dan followed him, wonderingly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH DAN SPENDS A NIGHT IN THE VALLEY OF TICK TOCK</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> As Dan, guided by Beader, entered the
town that lay in the center of the
Valley of Tick Tock, he saw that it
had been built so that the trees stood at the
foot of it while the corn patches and the wheat
fields stretched on both sides and one end.
From the fields and the woods streets ran
hither and thither at all sorts of angles. These
were lined with no end of queer houses. Some
were of sticks, and some were of weeds and
still others were made of very fine grass. Now
and then appeared a dwelling more imposing
than the rest. There was one that must
have been quite three stories high. All the
houses faced on extremely scant roadways that
could not have been more than two-mouses
wide.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>But the street over which Beader took Dan
was of a far different kind. Indeed, it was
almost as broad as a path in a park. It was
well sprinkled with sand and along both its
sides were rows of tall corn. Dan was about to
ask if the street had a name when he noted a
sign fixed to the top of a stick. Stooping
down he read:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>CORNSTALK AVENUE</div>
    <div>50 Dragoon Jumps to Public Square</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>And so, very shortly, he and his guide had
reached the heart of the town. Here, looking
down, the visitor saw that they had stopped
before what he judged was the armory. In
front of it stood a sentry box made from the
half of a corncob with windows cut in the
sides. Out of this stepped a mouse dressed
exactly like Beader, only in place of a sword he
carried a lantern.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dickory Dock,” said Dan’s guide.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Dickory Dock,” said the other. Then the
two of them came to salute after which Beader
unbuckled his belt and handed it and the
sword to the one with the lantern.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“Now, then,” cried he, “I’m off duty till
to-morrow! So, if you don’t mind, I’ll come
up there to your shoulder and conduct you
wherever you may care to go.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Do so, by all means,” answered Diggeldy
Dan; and soon the other was perched on the
folds of his ruff.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course,” began Beader, as he unbuttoned
the top of his rather tight-fitting coat, “you
must understand that this particular town is
only one of several here in the valley. There
is Stubbleton where the Fielders live and
that’s over in that direction. And there is
Nightsville, where most of the Muskers make
their home. It’s back yonder at the edge of
the pond. Then there’s Dorton—that’s the
Dormice settlement and it lies well in among
the trees. But it is here that we hold most of
our gatherings. I do wish you had been with
us last evening. There was a most exciting
drill between the Jumping Dragoons and the
Nightsville Musketeers. We beat them all
hollow at marching but we couldn’t put up
our tents quite as fast as they.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It must have been great sport,” said Dan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>“I wish there was something for us to see
to-night.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Goodness, I wish so too,” answered Beader.
“If it were only Clock Night. But it isn’t for
this is but the Day Before.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The day before,” repeated Dan, “the day
before what?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Day Before Clock Night. You see
we of the Valley of Tick Tock have only two
kinds of days. There is the Day Before Clock
Night and Clock Night Day; then it becomes
the Day Before Clock Night again; and so
on—over and over and over again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But why do you give them such curious
names?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why because—but listen! What is that?”
and Beader stood up and put his head to one
side. “Why, of course!” he exclaimed. “It’s
the voices of the Fielders. They must be out
harvesting. If you’ve never been to a moonlight
harvest bee I know you’ll enjoy it. So
come, let’s get over to the wheat field as fast
as we can.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Off they went, taking another path which
led in a direction opposite from that by which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>they had entered the town. Soon they were
at the edge of the field. As they neared it
Dan’s guide had leaped to the ground and
gone on in advance.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Beader, of the Dragoons,” the clown heard
him shout, “and I’m bringing a friend with
me.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come along, then,” cried voices in answer.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now,” said Beader to Dan, “if you don’t
mind getting down on your knees, you’ll be
able to see fairly well.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Dan did still more; he stretched out quite
flat and, with his chin propped in his hands,
peered in among the stalks of sweet-smelling
wheat. Of course there was the moon to help
out but, as any one knows who has peeped
into a field even on the brightest of nights,
there is little save darkness in the depths
underneath. So what was the visitor’s surprise
to see there quite clearly whole dozens of
workers as busy as bees.</p>

<p class='c012'>Yes, there they all were, around a mite of a
bonfire that was scarcely larger than five
candle flames. Yet, small as it was, it sent out
its flickerings in every direction and so lighted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>the wheat stalks for a full yard away. Still
other Fielders rushed about through the forest,
carrying lanterns and tiny leaf baskets. Up
the stalks they would go, fill their baskets
with wheat, scurry back to the ground, take
their loads to the fireside, and then hurry
away to do it all over again.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The Fielders are the very best of all the
harvesters,” said Beader, who had by now
taken a seat just under the end of Dan’s
long, funny nose. “They have a system for
everything they do. Those that you see sitting
near the fire are the sack makers. They gather
leaves and fashion them into the bags that hold
all the wheat. Those who are filling the bags
are called the sackers. They are mostly the
younger Fielders, as are those who bring
straws to keep up the fire. The most important
workers are the gleaners. They must be
good climbers and able to judge the very best
wheat. Hey, there, Friend Nibbler,” Beader
suddenly cried to a rather large mouse who
seemed to be directing the work, “can you
spare a moment?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Never too busy to pass the time of night,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>answered the one called Nibbler, as he came
toward them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is Diggeldy Dan,” introduced Beader.
“It’s his first time at a harvest bee. Nibbler
is in charge of the harvesting.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Glad to see you,” nodded the Fielder.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It’s all very interesting,” returned Dan,
“though from what I’ve seen it mustn’t be
very difficult to keep things going.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Everything does move pretty smoothly so
far as the older Fielders go,” agreed Nibbler,
“but I have a number of youngsters among
the sackers and some of them can’t count as
well as they might. You see the bags are
made to hold exactly fifty grains apiece and if
more goes in—especially if they are unusually
fat grains—two or three too many may
mean the splitting of a bag. And then some
of the other lads will stop to play when they
are out gathering straws and so let the fire
get low. See! It needs more fuel this very
minute! So if you’ll excuse me I’ll go see
to it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And away he went in search of the boys
who, as Dan plainly saw, were at that moment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>in the midst of a game of hide-and-go-seek just
beyond the edge of the light.</p>

<p class='c012'>“After the grains have been sacked,” Beader
continued to explain, “the bags are put away
in storehouses for winter use. Our people of
the town—that is to say, the House-mice—trade
cheese and cakes for wheat. We also
harvest quite a bit of corn.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are those all the things you have to eat?”
asked Dan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, dear, no,” answered the other. “There
are nuts, and the Muskers, for instance,
simply dote on apples. We always have an
apple-rolling when apples are ripe. That’s the
best fun of all. Sometimes we get an apple
well up the side of a slope and then somebody
starts laughing and it slips away and goes
scooting back again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Does any one ever bother you here in the
Valley of Tick Tock?” Dan asked.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, indeed. To begin with I guess no one
but the Pretty Lady with the Blue-Blue Eyes
and the White-White Horse would know how
to find us. And,” Beader added, drawing
himself up to his full height, “even if they did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>there are the Jumping Dragoons and the
Nightsville Musketeers. Some of us are always
on guard.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of course, of course,” agreed Dan, very
seriously, and very solemnly. “But tell me,
how is it you call yourselves dragoons and yet
have no horses?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, but we have. You see, I’m a dragoon
only on every Day Before Clock Night. On
Clock Night Day I’m a horse. That’s the
way we do in almost everything. We take
turns. I wasn’t riding my mouse-horse to-night
because we do that only when we
drill.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I see,” said Dan, “but about the different
clock days. You were to tell me—”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, look! Look!” broke in Beader.
“There, coming down that biggest stalk. It’s
Bounder, isn’t it? Why, of course it’s Bounder!
Who but he could do such a thing.
See! He’s bringing down a whole head at one
time and I’ll warrant there isn’t a lean grain
in all of it. I must speak to him.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Off he sprang and in two jumps had reached
the side of the one called Bounder. Up went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>one end of the head to his shoulder and then,
amid the cheers of the others, the red-coated
dragoon and the good-natured Bounder carried
the prize to the feet of the sackers. Of course
there was visiting and more or less handshaking
that might have kept up even longer than
it did had not Nibbler come up just then and
ordered everybody back to their various tasks.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fine folks, those Fielders, fine folks,”
vowed Beader, as he joined Dan a half-minute
after. “I do hope you’ll have time to
get over to Stubbleton to-morrow. They’d
not be able to do enough for you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wha—what did you say,” asked Dan,
suddenly lifting his head. “Please, do forgive
me—I really believe I was nodding!”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And no wonder!” cried Beader. “We’ve
already visited well into the morning. But
what a night it is! And what a moon! I say,
it’s really too nice to sleep indoors even if we
had a roof that would cover you. So what do
you say if we both make our beds in the corn
patch that lies just across from this field?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nothing would suit me better,” declared
Dan. So he and Beader set out for the patch.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>“Here’s just the place for me,” said the
mouse as he curled himself up at the foot of a
stalk.</p>

<p class='c012'>“While this space to the left must have been
just measured for me,” echoed Dan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So, then, good night,” answered Beader.
“And mind you, just sleep as long as you
like for I assure you you’ll not be disturbed.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But, though Dan had nodded while watching
the Fielders, the walk to the corn patch had
roused him again. As he lay there looking out
through the leaves into the face of the moon
he was reminded of the time when he had gone
to sleep with his head on Gray Ears’ great
trunk. The night was quite as still as the one
he had passed in the depths of the woods. Yet,
just as there had then been the song of the
cricket so now was there a sound to accompany
his thoughts. He had all but forgotten it
while attending the harvest bee. But now he
heard it more distinctly than ever. Whether
it came from the south or the north, or came
from the west or the east he could not be sure.
Perhaps it was wafted on breezes that swung
over the hills. But, from no matter whence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>the sound floated toward him: “Tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, Beader,” he called, determined to
find out just what it was that gave forth the
strange note. “Oh, Beader.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But Beader was fast, fast asleep. So Dan
said no more. And soon he, too, had followed
the example of the little dragoon, while all
through the valley went the voice that seemed
never to sleep, saying “Tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock—”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH DAN IS PRESENTED WITH THE KEY TO THE VALLEY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> Having tarried in Slumberland until
well into the morning, Dan finally
made known his intention of quitting
it by rolling his head to one side, wrinkling the
end of his long, funny nose, and puckering his
forehead in the very same spot where his brow
was adorned with a red polka dot. Still, he did
not at once rouse himself. In fact, so to put
it, he really awakened a bit at a time. And it
was while he was not yet more than half, or, at
the very most, only two-thirds awake, that he
felt something tickling the tops of his knees.
This caused him to wiggle the ends of his toes
and to pucker his brow even more than before.
But the tickling persisted and so, at last fully
awakened, he opened his eyes and sat straight
up between the tall stalks of corn.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“A good morning, Sir Clown,” cried a
welcoming voice.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the sound of it, Dan looked to the right
and looked to the left. But naught could he
see save the green of the corn and the splashes
of sunlight that patterned the ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here we are—out here!” again called the
voice. And looking down, Dan saw a most
remarkable sight. There, drawn up in two
lines along the ridge of his legs and extending
well over his knees, were two entire companies
of the Jumping Dragoons. He knew them at
once, for all wore coats, caps and trousers that
were exact copies of Beader’s; while, square at
the head of them, astride a mouse in silver-trimmed
trappings, was none other than that
worthy, himself.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My, my; we thought you never would
waken!” exclaimed Dan’s guide of the night,
“but now that you have, allow me to present
my comrades of the Micetown Dragoons.”
At the precise moment that Beader pronounced
the “goons” in dragoons, he drew his
sword from its scabbard and held it fixed at
salute while, with a rattle and swish and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>flourishing flip, all the rest of the mice followed
suit.</p>

<p class='c012'>“My respects to you to all and a good wish
for each one,” returned Dan, as he bowed as
best he could sitting down, “I assure you I
am honored by this courtly attention.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Now then, fall out!” Beader commanded,
“and make haste to bring forward our guest’s
breakfast rations.” Off Dan’s legs they all
tumbled; down past his feet they all went,
and were soon coming back carrying whole
dozens of morsels of cream cheese and cake.
These they piled high in Dan’s willing lap and,
a half-minute after, the clown was eating his
fill while the red-coated dragoons perched upon
his knees, feet and shoulders—visiting and
chattering for quite all they were worth.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I suppose you are surprised to see me in
uniform after what I told you last night,”
Beader said. “But, since it was I who first
guided you, all the dragoons insisted that I
should lead them to the corn patch this morning.
Besides, Plunger didn’t mind being a
horse for to-day. Did you, Plunger?” he appealed
to the mouse upon whose back he sat.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>“Ne—he—he,” answered Plunger, shaking
his head and pawing Dan’s ruff with one foot.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He means, ‘No, not a bit,’” Beader explained.
“You see it is one of our rules that
when a dragoon is a horse he is not to utter a
word. He may only whinny, or say ‘no’ or
‘yes’ with his head.”</p>

<p class='c012'>So, as they talked, Dan finished his breakfast.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That over with, we will prepare to move
to the square,” announced Beader. “Dragoons
fall in!”</p>

<p class='c012'>At this word from their leader, the others
all sprang to the furrow and were soon once
more at attention.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Forwar—r—r—d, ha!” came from Beader.
Onward they marched until the rear of their
lines had passed well beyond the clown’s
feet.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Halt!” ordered Beader. “Now then, you,
Diggeldy Dan, will march just behind the tails
that come last. You, band-mice, will take up
your position just behind Dan.”</p>

<p class='c012'>With this last command a group of beady-eyed
fellows swung into view from an adjoining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>furrow. They wore jackets of green that
contrasted in most lively fashion with their
pink pantaloons and still pinker hats. As
for instruments, there were what one might
have called fifes, which were made by placing
blades of green grass between two whittled
sticks; and fully two dozen drums fashioned
from corncobs with the ends covered over
with well-seasoned husks. On the head of
the largest drum, Dan read the words:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>Fielders’ Fife and Drum Corps</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The players were led by an unusually tall
mouse who seemed all the taller because of the
great plush hat that he wore. This was held
in place by a strap that passed under his chin.
He carried a glistening stick, with a knob at
one end, which he spun high overhead as he
marched. Dan knew him at once; it was
Bounder, who had garnered the whole head
of wheat.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus brought into formation by Beader—their
mile-high guest towering above them—the
mice slowly emerged from the corn patch.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>Soon they had reached one of the broad,
sanded paths that led into the town. Already
the merry notes of the fifes and the rattle of
drums heralded the procession’s approach.
Small wonder, then, that windows were jammed
with vast numbers of spectators and the
sides of the avenue simply gray with the
crowd. Many of the younger mice had
climbed up the corn stalks that bordered the
street, while others trailed in the rear of the
drummers or kept pace with Bounder as he
twirled his baton.</p>

<p class='c012'>Beader, astride Plunger, was everywhere at
once, so it seemed: First at the head of the
column and then at the back of it; now along
one flank and now down the other—giving this
order or that in a manner that called forth
much admiration. At each of the corners were
important mice in blue coats who waved back
the throngs as the marchers drew near and
touched their helmets as Dan passed their
stations.</p>

<p class='c012'>Such were the scenes that greeted Dan’s
eyes as the procession moved onward to finally
arrive at the square. Big as it was, the plaza
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>looked to be completely carpeted with mice.
These were of every color and size and all
smartly attired in holiday dress. On a central
platform was another mouse band. Its players
blew lustily on pipes and on horns that were
made from parts of wheat stalks. Just in
front of the bandstand—but on a different
and still higher platform—stood a table and,
behind the table, four chairs in a row. As for
decorations—there, seemed to be no end of
them. Bandstand and platform were draped
with bunting, and flags and gay pennants
fluttered forth on all sides.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now, at the point where Dan had come to a
halt was a wide-spreading tree whose undermost
branches just tipped the top of his sugar-loaf
hat. This tree shaded the greater part
of the square. Looking up from the scene that
lay at his feet, the clown noticed a string
dangling quite near his nose. Following the
length of it with a curious eye, he saw that it
passed through a miniature pulley that was
fixed to a branch of the tree. One half of the
string ran down at a slant to be lost at a
point where the Jumping Dragoons had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>drawn up at attention. The other part of the
string hung almost straight down until it
reached the table that stood on the platform.
And now Dan saw that a flag had been placed
over the top of the table and that the end of
the string passed under the folds of it. Even
as he looked there came a stir in the crowd and
another in the branches that spread near his
head. Glancing up, he saw Beader spring
to his shoulder and, again looking down,
beheld four exceedingly dignified mice ascending
the steps that led to the platform. All
wore glossy silk hats, which were removed as
they reached the top of the steps and then
carefully placed under the four separate chairs
that stood in a row near the table. Then they
sat down and began mopping their brows with
handkerchiefs which they drew from their
pockets.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are our mayors,” Beader imparted,
as the band struck up an entirely new air, “of
Dorton, of Nightsville, of Stubbleton, and
here.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The band again silent, the most portly
mouse advanced to the flag-covered table.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“Mayor Mouser, of Micetown,” whispered
Beader.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Friends and fellow mice,” began the speaker,
“we are gathered here to-day to welcome to
our midst one who has traveled from afar.
We have—”</p>

<p class='c012'>And standing there with his head against
the branches—Beader whispering explanations
of all that was not clear to him—Dan listened
to this welcoming speech.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And now, in conclusion,” said the mayor,
“I have, in the name of all our villages, the
honor of presenting Diggeldy Dan, with the
key to the Valley of Tick Tock.” As he said
this he lifted one hand in signal toward the
companies of Jumping Dragoons. Instantly
Dan saw that the red-coated ones had taken
hold of that end of the string which lay nearest
them. Now they ran outward quite as if they
were playing at tug-of-war. At the same
moment the string tightened in the pulley, and
then—up from the table came the flag. As it
unfurled to the breeze, Dan saw that its
emblem was a sheaf of bright yellow wheat.
Under the flag hung a bit of free string and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>fast to the end of it—spinning and glittering
as it came—was a golden key scarcely longer
than Dan’s little finger! In a second the key
had been drawn up on a level with his face
and, prompted by Beader, the clown untied it
amid wave upon wave of heartiest cheers and
the gayest of gala-day music.</p>

<p class='c012'>While the huzzas were in progress any who
were not looking at Dan might have noted
that the four on the platform were in close
consultation. A moment later Mayor Mouser
again waved for attention.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am happy to say that I have still another
announcement to make,” said he, when silence
had fallen. “Of course the greater part of our
guest’s day and evening will be taken up with
the tour of the valley. But this, as we all
know, being Clock Day Night, I ask that all
of you who can possibly do so, be in the
square at midnight. For it has been unanimously
decided that Diggeldy Dan is to
accompany us to Hear the Clock Strike One!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Cheer after cheer greeted this news. Again
Dan was reminded of the queer tower that he
had seen among the trees when he first entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>the valley. Again he recalled the strange
sound that had lulled him to sleep. He
wondered if these things were to play a part
in the promised adventure. But there was no
time to ask. Already Beader had descended to
the ground and was bringing the dragoons to
attention; already a new procession was being
formed to escort Dan on his tour through the
Valley of Tick Tock.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now Bounder had begun to twirl his stick
Skyward and the fifes to make merry and the
drums to beat. So, still wondering—the golden
key clasped tightly in one hand—Dan marched
from the plaza, bowing first one way and then
the other to the crowd or waving his pointed
hat toward wee mice-in-arms that were held
upward to claim his attention.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <span class='large'>IN WHICH DAN HEARS THE CLOCK STRIKE ONE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> Now should you ever, like Dan, some
day visit the Valley of Tick Tock,
and, reaching the plaza that lies in the
very center of Micetown, take eleven steps
to the east and then ten to the south, you
would, like as not, come upon a vine-covered
mound something of the width, the shape
and the height of a haycock. And were you
to thrust the vines to one side, you would
find that they covered the face of two wooden
doors, so fashioned and hinged as to part in
the middle. But did you seek to open them
to learn what might be concealed underneath,
you would discover that something
forbade you to do so. And after you had
tugged, and then tugged again, and probably
said “Oh, dear,” at your failure, you would
seek out the reason and find it to be a stout
and wholly unyielding lock.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>But this is something with which you will
doubtless never contend. Not that you will
never visit the valley, but because, if you do,
you will most likely be accompanied as was
Diggeldy Dan. For, at the end of the day and
the first hours of the night spent in journeys
to Stubbleton, Dorton and Nightsville, the
clown found himself marching toward this very
same knoll that has been described as resembling
a haycock.</p>

<p class='c012'>What a marvelous multitude attended him!
Of course there were the dragoons, and there
were the bands, and there were the mayors,—all
four of them. The latter now rode in
splendid corncob carriages, drawn by mice in
harness and plumes and driven by others with
cockades on their hats. At the rear and both
sides walked mice in such numbers, and so
packed together, that as Dan looked down on
them it seemed as though the very ground was
in motion. And when, now and then, the vast
procession came to a pause—as processions are
likely to do—there was not the slightest bit of
confusion. This was because every mouse
instantly stepped on the tail of that mouse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>who walked just in front of him and so held
him quite fast just as he, in turn, was held in
his tracks by the one who came to a halt
right behind him.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nearly all had brought lamps. These were
not carried but were fastened to the caps that
all of them wore. This gave the throng a most
picturesque look. It made Dan think of a
torchlight procession and, again, of the lights
that jewel a town when one views it from some
distant hillside. Just why the mice had been
provided with lamps Dan could not guess; for
the moon now floated high in the skies and
flooded every inch of the way. But he was
soon to find out, for it was not long before the
mayors drew up in the lee of the knoll that
looked so much like a haycock. Up the vines
went the dragoons and, pulling this way and
that, quickly bared the two doors to full
view. Next Mayor Mouser and his companions
alighted. Looking back, Dan saw that all the
attending throng were standing upon each
other’s tails as though awaiting some momentous
event.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Advance to the portals, Diggeldy Dan!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>cried Mayor Mouser, as he waved toward the
tightly locked doors. With two strides the
clown stood before them.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have the key?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Right here in my hand,” Dan made haste
to reply, as he held the object on high that all
might observe it.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then, be it known to you that that which
you hold is the key to the underground
passage—the passage that leads to the
Clock.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are we all ready?” called Mayor Mouser,
as he leaped to the seat of his carriage the
better to look back across the vast sea of faces
that stretched for yard after yard down the
avenue.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, yes!” answered a thousand and one
voices as their owners danced with impatience
upon a thousand and one tails.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then, Dan—open the doors!”</p>

<p class='c012'>At this command the clown dropped to both
knees. Quickly he thrust the key in the lock
and turned it as swiftly with a twist to the
right. As he did so the dragoons swung the
two doors apart. And there, before him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>and leading into the knoll, was a tunnel as
black as the darkest of nights.</p>

<p class='c012'>Into this curious passage leaped the van of
the column, waving bright torches high overhead.
The bands followed after and next came
the mayors—all four of them—marching abreast.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now Dan had sunk down on his knees when
he unlocked the doors and so was quite in a
position to enter the passage—not walking
upright, as you may well suppose, but moving
along on “all fours.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Down, down and still downward they all
traveled. Around and around they all wound
their way. Now and then the passage opened
into galleries of considerable size. Still other
tunnels branched into these and from out of
them trooped yet other mice to join in the
endless procession.</p>

<p class='c012'>“They are those who have entered the
tunnels that join this larger one as it winds
under Dorton, Stubbleton and Nightsville,”
Beader explained. “But we have passed the
last galleries and will soon be in the Great
Room. You may even now be able to see the
lights up ahead.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>And Dan could. There, far beyond and
above the heads of the mice that marched in
front of him, was a faint yellow glow. This
grew brighter and wider as they advanced.
Then, two minutes after, the column entered
the room that Beader had promised.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Great Room was quite big enough to
allow Dan to stand upright. Its walls formed
an oblong and along these walls were an
almost countless number of balconies to the
railings of which scores of torches were fixed.
Dozens upon dozens of tiny stairways ran from
the balconies while still other flights connected
the higher ones with those that were under
them. The room had no furnishings. Its
floor was of stone and worn almost to a polish
as though it had been visited time after time
by thousands after thousands of feet.</p>

<p class='c012'>Having observed this much, Dan looked
overhead. It was then he discovered that the
room had no ceiling. At first he thought he
was peering into the skies, so deep was the
gloom up above. But, try as he would, no
stars could he see nor yet so much as a glint
of the moon. Indeed, there was nothing but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>the rather dim outline of a most confusing
something that swung first to right and then to
the left like the pendulum that sways in a clock.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Like the pendulum that sways in a clock,”
puzzled Dan, as he put his thoughts into
words. “Why is it a pendulum!”</p>

<p class='c012'>Even as he spoke his ears detected the
steady “tick-tock, tick-tock” that he had
heard when he first entered the valley. And
the sound came from a point right over his
head! Now he knew; now his eyes, grown
accustomed to the gloom, told him he was
right. He was looking up into the great
tower—the tower that he had seen with its
head thrust through the trees. And, as if to
favor the watcher, the moon at that moment
sent some of its beams through a chink at the
top, plainly disclosing whole mazes of wheels
and two hands of tremendous size. The hour
lacked but five minutes of one!</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” said Beader, who had by this time
mounted to Dan’s ruff, “the Great Room is
directly under the Clock. And now if you
will stand right where you are you will see and
hear all that takes place. That’s my balcony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>up yonder and I must be getting over to it at
once.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Away he scampered and as he did so Dan
saw that all the mice were mounting the stairways
and climbing to the balconies that
bordered the room. In the largest of these, at
the center of the topmost tier, a choir was
being formed. One who seemed to be the
leader gave the pitch now and then by blowing
upon a stalk of wheat. Then, at a signal, the
chorus began:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dickory, dickory dock;</div>
      <div class='line'>Dickory, dickory dock.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>These same words were chanted over and
over and over again, but with many changes
of melody. As the chorus rang through the
Great Room, Dan saw that those in the
balconies were standing on very tiptoes, as if
eager to be off to he knew not where. Suddenly
more words were added to the song:</p>

<div id='i_235'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_235.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>At the boom of “One” the mice fairly rained into the Great Room. <em>Page <a href='#Page_235'>235</a>.</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>“The mice ran up the clock,” sang the
voices. Instantly the air seemed filled with
flying mice. From every balcony they sprang—mayors,
dragoons, band-mice, and all—leaping upon the great pendulum that swung across
the width of the room. And, reaching it, up
the great shaft they went—upward into the
very tower of the Clock. There were those
who missed when they jumped. But these
picked themselves up in a twinkling, dashed
back to the balconies and once more leaped
for the pendulum. Now, all others gone, the
singers followed their fellows until, at last,
only Dan remained in the Great Room.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dickory, dickory dock,</div>
      <div class='line'>The mice ran up the clock,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>came the far-away voices of the chorus.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tick-tock, tick-tock,” sang the Clock in
reply.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then it gave forth a great “bur-r-r-rr” that
shook the tower to its very base.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The clock struck one,” chorused the choir.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Boom!” went the Clock.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The mice ran down—” began the singers.
But whether the verse was completed Dan
could not tell. For, at the boom of “One”
the mice fairly rained into the Great Room.
Down they came, laughing, tumbling, racing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>and scrambling pell-mell—all bound for the
tunnel that led to the knoll. Into the passage
they went, some riding on the backs of their
comrades or smaller ones clinging fast to the
tails of those who were larger and swifter than
they. Last of all came the mayors holding
tight to their hats. With such speed did all
travel that the echo of “One” had hardly
completed its rounds of the tower when the
Great Room was empty. Yet not quite empty
for, as Dan turned to follow, there came a
patter of feet near his own. It was Beader
who had returned to escort him back through
the passage.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wasn’t it fun!” cried the red-coated dragoon
as the two of them entered the tunnel.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fun!” answered Dan, “why it’s more than
that—it’s a story! What a tale I shall have to
tell when I get back to the menagerie tent!
But, now that I have my story, I suppose I
should be returning to the corn patch where
we first met, for it may be that the Pretty
Lady will be waiting to carry me back to
Spangleland.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Then we will take this passage to the left,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>said Beader. “It will bring us out but a few
steps from there.” So the two pressed forward
with no light to guide them save the wee
lamp that the dragoon wore in his cap. Suddenly
Beader stopped.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I heard it, too,” chimed Dan. “It was a
neigh! The White-White Horse must be near
the mouth of the passage. Come, let us
hurry.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Soon they were standing in the moonlight
and there, sure enough, was the one with the
Blue-Blue Eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I knew you were coming,” she said. “I
could hear your voices under the ground. But
now you must bid Beader farewell, else we
will never reach the circus by dawn.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A good-by and no end of thanks to you,
Friend Beader,” exclaimed Dan.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A good-by to you, Diggeldy Dan,” the
dragoon cried warmly, as the clown sprang to
his seat. “And do come and visit us again
some day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed, I shall try,” called Dan in return
as the White-White Horse started off down
the slope. And looking back he could see that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Beader had mounted to the top of a cornstalk.
There he stood, waving his plumed cap over
his head, his red coat a bright spot in the
moonlight.</p>

<p class='c012'>Soon the hoofs of the White-White Horse
began to play a soft tattoo on the turf and the
Pretty Lady’s laugh to ring merrily in tune
with it. But these sounds could not shut out
another that Dan fancied still filled the air. It
seemed to come from the fast receding valley,
growing fainter and fainter and fainter, yet still
saying, “Tick-took, tick-tock, tick-took.”</p>

<p class='c017'>So we will leave Dan here—leave him as he
is being carried back to the great menagerie
tent where (you may be very sure) he told
every wee bit of the tiniest part of his adventure
to the animals who awaited his coming.
“And, after that?” you no doubt are asking,
“did he return to see Beader? Or ever again
go adventuring with Gray Ears, the Elephant?
And the Pretty Lady with the Blue-Blue
Eyes; did she carry more of the animals into
the wide wide world on the White-White
Horse? And did Dan—”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'> Stop! Stop! Thumb-bobs and tack hammers,
what a collection of questions!</p>

<p class='c012'>“But how is one to know when there
are no more pages that tell?” you persist.</p>

<p class='c012'>How, indeed! And yet there is a way. For
one may always summon those two marvelous
playfellows, <em>Guess</em> and <em>Suppose</em>, and with
them seek out even Diggeldy Dan. And,
having caught up with him, you’ll find the
blue-eyed one, too; and (like as not) Lion, and
Monkey, and Tiger, and Seal, and the rest of
the whole merry crew. For none of them is
ever a great ways away,—at least no farther
than the circus is near.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But,” you enquire, after considering this
plan for a minute or more, “will they talk to
me when once I do find them?”</p>

<p class='c012'>Perhaps. And yet you must not be sad if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>they will not. Instead, you should recall
what Gray Ears once said in speaking to Dan.
“Unless I am away from the circus, I rarely
talk to any one,” he warned. “Indeed you
might spend months upon months with the
Very Biggest Circus and yet never hear one
of its animals utter so much as a word.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
